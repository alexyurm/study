How to Write Go Code

-  Code organization

    -   Workspaces

    Go code must be kept inside a workspace. A workspace is the root
    directory of your project.

    -   sub-folders

        src -   contains Go source file organized into packages
        pkg -   contains package objects
        bin -   contains executable commands

-   The GoPATH environment variable

    The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your 
    workspace. E.g.

    $ mkdir $HOME/go
    $ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    $ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

    (note: $HOME/go is your project root directory)

-   Package paths

    -   Standard libraries' packages

    The packages from the standard libraries are given short paths such as
    "fmt", and "net/http".

    -   Your own packages

    For your own packages, you MUST choose a base path that is unlikely to
    collide with future additions to the standard library or other external
    libraries.

    If you keep your code in a source repository somewhere, then you should
    use the root of that source repository as your base path.

    For instance, if you have a GitHub account at github.com/user, that
    should be your base path.
