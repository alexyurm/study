          A bug has been fixed that caused a GDB internal error when
	  using the <span class="command"><strong>finish</strong></span> command.  The bug occurred
	  when debugging optimized code.
        </p><p><b>GDB backwards compatibility fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GDB to crash when loading symbols
          from binaries built by very old versions of GCC.
        </p><p><b>Overloaded function resolution. </b>
	  The C++ compiler now correctly diagnoses an error when the
	  second operand of a comma expression is an unresolved set of
	  overloaded functions.  Previously, it incorrectly used the
	  context of the comma expression to resolve the function. 
        </p><p><b>Fix for <code class="function">backtrace</code>
	  function in dynamically-linked executables. </b>
          The <code class="function">backtrace</code> function now reports
	  backtraces for dynamically-linked executables.  Previously,
	  this function worked only with statically-linked
	  executables, i.e., executables linked with
	  <code class="option">-static</code>.
        </p><p><b>Pointer-to-member functions. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the C++ compiler to crash
	  when compiling a pointer-to-member function reference
	  without an explicit <code class="code">&amp;</code> operator.  This
	  syntax is allowed only when the
	  <code class="option">-fms-extensions</code> command-line option is
	  used.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id277990"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2009q1-176</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Assembler fix for <code class="option">-mauto-it</code>. </b>
	  A bug in the assembler that caused incorrect assembly
	  of branches has been fixed.  The bug only occurred when
	  automatically generating IT instructions using
	  <code class="option">-mauto-it</code>.
	</p><p><b>Fix for <code class="function">dlopen</code> in statically-linked executables. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that made statically-linked programs
          crash when calling <code class="function">dlopen</code> with
          <code class="constant">RTLD_GLOBAL</code> to request global availability
          of symbols from the shared module.
        </p><p><b>Overlay sections. </b>
          <span class="command"><strong>arm-none-linux-gnueabi-readelf</strong></span> now correctly recognizes
          section headers for <code class="literal">ARM_DEBUGOVERLAY</code>
          and <code class="literal">ARM_OVERLAYSECTION</code> sections. 
        </p><p><b>Linker bug fix. </b>
          A bug that caused the linker to crash when
          <code class="literal">.ARM.exidx</code> sections were discarded by a
          linker script has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect placement of linker-generated functions. </b>
          A bug that caused some linker-generated functions (including
	  stubs to support interworking from ARM mode to Thumb mode and
	  stubs to avoid processor errata) to be placed in data sections
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>New option for automatically generating IT blocks. </b>
          The assembler now allows use of conditional Thumb-2 instructions without
          requiring explicit IT instructions.
          Use the <code class="option">-mauto-it</code> command-line option to enable this
          automatic generation of IT instructions.
        </p><p><b>Optimized <code class="function">memcpy</code>. </b>
          The implementation of <code class="function">memcpy</code> has
          been optimized to increase performance on ARM targets that
          support prefetch instructions.
        </p><p><b>Optimized memory and string routines. </b>
          The implementations of <code class="function">memcpy</code>,
          <code class="function">memset</code>, <code class="function">strcmp</code>,
          <code class="function">strcpy</code>, and <code class="function">strlen</code>
          have been optimized to increase performance on ARM targets.
          
        </p><p><b>Reduced compilation time. </b>
	  Compilation and build times when using Sourcery G++ Lite are now
	  slightly faster.  This performance improvement is the result
	  of building the compilers and other host tools with a recent
          version of Sourcery G++, rather than an older GCC version.
        </p><p><b>Support for GLIBC <code class="function">backtrace</code> function. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ Lite now supports the GLIBC <code class="function">backtrace</code>
	  function on ARM GNU/Linux targets.
	  For more information, see <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#sec-backtrace" title="GLIBC Backtrace Support">the section called &#8220;GLIBC Backtrace Support&#8221;</a>.
	</p><p><b>Assembler bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the assembler that caused duplicate and missing
          mapping symbols has been fixed.  The bug caused incorrect
          <span class="command"><strong>objdump</strong></span> output and incorrect
          byte-swapping for BE8 configurations.
        </p><p><b>Stack backtracing and C++ exception handling. </b>
	  Improvements have been made to the linker in support of
	  C++ runtime exception handling and stack backtracing.
	  A problem that caused crashes during the backtrace of C routines
	  that were not compiled with the <code class="option">-fexceptions</code>
	  option has been fixed.
	  In addition, the linker generates more compact stack unwinding
	  tables which can lead to smaller executables.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect linker-generated functions. </b>
	  A bug that caused some linker-generated functions (such as stubs
	  to support interworking from ARM mode to Thumb mode) to contain only
	  <code class="literal">nop</code> instructions instead of correct code sequences
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Assembler diagnostics for invalid instructions. </b>
	  The assembler now issues diagnostics for invalid
	  <code class="literal">ADR</code> and <code class="literal">ADRL</code> instructions.
	  Formerly, these invalid instructions were silently mis-assembled.
	  This assembler bug did not affect correct code.
	</p><p><b>Sprite's failure to reset the target. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that sometimes caused the Sourcery G++
	  Debug Sprite to fail to reset the target when using the
	  multiple sequential connection feature (enabled via the
	  <code class="option">-m</code> command-line option).  This problem was
	  specific to running the Debug Sprite on Microsoft Windows
	  hosts.
        </p><p><b>Disassembler bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect disassembly of
          some object files with multiple sections whose symbol tables
          included symbols in the middle of functions.  These
          typically resulted from hand-written assembly.
        </p><p><b>Linker crash with very large applications. </b>
	  A linker bug that caused a crash when linking very large
	  applications with the <code class="option">--fix-cortex-a8</code>
	  command-line option has been fixed.
        </p><p><b><span class="command"><strong>arm-none-linux-gnueabi-objcopy</strong></span> bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused
          <span class="command"><strong>arm-none-linux-gnueabi-objcopy</strong></span> to issue an error
          when generating output in the Intel HEX format and using
          <code class="option">--change-section-lma</code> to change section
          addresses.
        </p><p><b>Linker script search path. </b>
          The bug in the linker has been fixed that caused it not to
          follow its documented behavior for searching for linker
          scripts named with the <code class="option">-T</code> option.  Now
          scripts are looked up first in the current directory, then
          in library directories specified with <code class="option">-L</code>
          command-line options, and finally in the default system
          linker script directory.
        </p><p><b>Errors when inserting breakpoints. </b>
	  A GDB bug has been fixed that caused errors of the form
	  <code class="literal">
	    `<em class="replaceable"><code>function</code></em>' found in
	    <em class="replaceable"><code>filename</code></em> psymtab but not in symtab
	  </code>
	  when setting a breakpoint on <em class="replaceable"><code>function</code></em>.
	  This error commonly occurred when setting breakpoints on functions
	  provided by the C library.
	</p><p><b>Cortex-A8 erratum workaround enabled for ARMv7-A. </b>
          The workaround for the erratum in Cortex-A8 processors mentioned
          below is now enabled by default if you are targeting the ARMv7-A
          architecture profile.  The workaround can be disabled by passing
          the <code class="option">--no-fix-cortex-a8</code> option to the linker.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error when optimizing. </b>
	  A bug has been fixed that caused <code class="literal">internal compiler
	  error: in build2_stat</code> when compiling.
        </p><p><b>Erratum workaround for Cortex-A8 processors. </b>
          The linker now implements a workaround for an erratum
          in Cortex-A8 processors.  If you are targeting an
          affected part and wish to use the workaround, pass the
          <code class="option">--fix-cortex-a8</code> option to the linker.
          Please contact ARM for further details of the erratum.
        </p><p><b>Maximum code alignment increased. </b>
          The maximum allowed code alignment has been increased from
          32 to 64 bytes. This change affects the <code class="literal">.p2align</code>
          and <code class="literal">.align</code> directives in GAS and the
	  <code class="option">-falign-functions</code> GCC option.
        </p><p><b>Corruption of block-scope variables. </b>
          A compiler optimization bug that sometimes caused corruption of
	  stack-allocated variables has been fixed.  The bug affected 
	  variables declared in a local block scope in functions containing
	  multiple non-overlapping lexical block scopes, a technique
	  commonly used by programmers to reduce stack frame size.
	  In some rare cases, other optimizations performed by the
	  compiler were ignoring the local extent of such block-scope
	  variables.
        </p><p><b>ARM EABI attributes. </b>
          An assembler bug that resulted in some object files
	  generated from hand-written assembly being incorrectly
 	  tagged as using VFP instructions has been fixed.  This
          tagging was harmless for objects linked with Sourcery G++
	  tools and libraries, but may have affected third-party
	  tools and libraries.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id278713"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2009q1-123</h3></div></div></div><p><b>
	 Incorrect code when using <code class="option">-falign-labels</code>
        . </b>
	  A bug that caused the compiler to generate incorrect code
	  for <code class="code">switch</code> statements when the
          <code class="option">-falign-labels</code> option is used has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>ARMv4T library selection. </b>
          Compiler options such as <code class="option">-mcpu=arm740t</code>,
          specifying an ARMv4T CPU, now cause the compiler to link
          with the ARMv4T libraries without
          requiring <code class="option">-march=armv4t</code> to be specified as
          well.
        </p><p><b>Core files in GDB. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that caused incorrect values for
	  CPSR (the status register) to be displayed when debugging
	  core files. In some cases, this bug could also cause the
	  <span class="command"><strong>gcore</strong></span> command to crash GDB.
	</p><p><b>Loop optimization improvements. </b>
          A new option, <code class="option">-fpromote-loop-indices</code>, has
          been added to the compiler.  Specifying this option enables an
          optimization that improves the performance of loops with index
          variables of integer types narrower than the target machine
          word size, such as <span class="type">char</span> or <span class="type">short</span>.
          This optimization also applies to <span class="type">int</span> on 64-bit
          targets.
        </p><p><b>Support for VFP and Advanced SIMD (NEON) register display. </b>
          The Sourcery G++ debugger can now display VFP and Advanced
          SIMD registers when debugging Linux applications with
	  <span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span>.  This may require a kernel
	  patch; see <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#sec-kernel-version" title="Target Kernel Requirements">the section called &#8220;Target Kernel Requirements&#8221;</a> for details.
        </p><p><b>Extraneous linker error messages. </b>
	  A linker bug that caused extraneous error messages of the form
	  <code class="code">Dwarf Error: Offset (507) greater than or equal to
	 .debug_str size (421).</code> has been corrected.  This bug did not
	 affect the correctness of output binaries.
	</p><p><b>Assembler marking of data. </b>
          Data generated using the assembler directives
          <code class="code">.ascii</code>, <code class="code">.asciz</code>,
          <code class="code">.dc.d</code>, <code class="code">.dc.s</code>, <code class="code">.dc.x</code>,
          <code class="code">.dcb</code>, <code class="code">.dcb.b</code>, <code class="code">.dcb.d</code>,
          <code class="code">.dcb.l</code>, <code class="code">.dcb.s</code>,
          <code class="code">.dcb.w</code>, <code class="code">.dcb.x</code>, <code class="code">.ds</code>,
          <code class="code">.ds.b</code>, <code class="code">.ds.d</code>, <code class="code">.ds.l</code>,
          <code class="code">.ds.p</code>, <code class="code">.ds.s</code>, <code class="code">.ds.w</code>,
          <code class="code">.ds.x</code>, <code class="code">.double</code>,
          <code class="code">.fill</code>, <code class="code">.float</code>,
          <code class="code">.incbin</code>, <code class="code">.single</code>,
          <code class="code">.space</code>, <code class="code">.skip</code>,
          <code class="code">.string</code>, <code class="code">.string8</code>,
          <code class="code">.string16</code>, <code class="code">.string32</code>,
          <code class="code">.string64</code>, and <code class="code">.zero</code> is now
          correctly marked by the assembler as data rather than code.
          This fixes incorrect byte-swapping of such data when linking
          for BE8 configurations.
        </p><p><b>VFP ABI support. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now supports the VFP variant of the Procedure
	  Call Standard for
	  the <span class="trademark">ARM</span>®
	  Architecture (AAPCS) in addition to the default soft-float ABI.
	  The VFP ABI uses VFP registers to
	  pass function arguments and return values, resulting in
	  faster floating-point code.
	  Code compiled with the VFP ABI is not compatible
	  with the soft-float ABI libraries provided with Sourcery G++ Lite;
	  however, VFP ABI libraries for little-endian ARM v7-A processors
	  are now available as add-ons for Sourcery G++ Professional Edition.
	  
	  For further information about floating-point compiler,
	  ABI and library support in Sourcery G++, refer to
	  <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#sec-armfloat-abi" title="Enabling Hardware Floating Point">the section called &#8220;Enabling Hardware Floating Point&#8221;</a>.
	</p><p><b>Improved vectorization. </b>
          Automatic vectorization for NEON now uses the fused
	  multiply-add (<code class="literal">VMLA</code>) and fused
	  multiply-subtract (<code class="literal">VMLS</code>) instructions.
	  These fused instructions are faster than the equivalent
	  two-instruction sequence consisting of a multiply followed
	  by an add or subtract.
        </p><p><b>GDB <span class="command"><strong>quit</strong></span> error. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that
	  caused <span class="command"><strong>quit</strong></span> to report <code class="literal">Quitting:
	  You can't do that without a process to debug.</code> when
	  debugging a core dump file.
	</p><p><b>Out-of-bounds accesses to stack arrays. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused internal compiler errors
          when some code involving out-of-bounds accesses to
          stack-allocated arrays was compiled with
          the <code class="option">-mthumb</code> option.  Such code is not valid
          C; although it is now accepted by the compiler and no
          diagnostic is issued, it has undefined behavior if executed.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id279160"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2009q1-117</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Thread cancellation in <code class="function">aio_suspend</code>. </b>
          A bug in the Thumb-2 version of
          <code class="function">aio_suspend</code> has been fixed that caused
          programs to crash if the calling thread was canceled.
        </p><p><b>Linking big-endian programs for ARMv7-A. </b>
          When linking for ARMv7-A targets with <code class="option">-mbig-endian</code>,
          Sourcery G++ now implicitly assumes BE8 mode, rather than BE32.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.3.3. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM GNU/Linux is now based on GCC version 4.3.3.
          This is a bug fix update to GCC.
          For more information about changes from GCC version 4.3.2 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Improved NOP generation for Thumb-2 cores. </b>
	  The assembler now generates Thumb-2/ARMv6K architectural NOP
	  instructions when alignment padding is required in code sections.
        </p><p><b>ARM atomic memory operations. </b>
          Support has been added for atomic memory operations in ARM
          Linux applications via built-in functions (for example,
          <code class="code">__sync_fetch_and_add</code>). Please refer to the GCC
          manual (Atomic Builtins) for further information.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error with <code class="option">-O3</code>
        or <code class="option">-fpredictive-commoning</code>. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused internal compiler errors
          when compiling some code with <code class="option">-O3</code>
          or <code class="option">-fpredictive-commoning</code>.
        </p><p><b>CS3 board and processor support. </b>
	  CS3 board and processor support has been cleaned up to remove
	  entries that are not appropriate for or supported by Sourcery G++ Lite
	  on ARM GNU/Linux targets.  This includes processors for which
	  Sourcery G++ Lite does not include appropriate run-time libraries.
          <span>
            In addition, CS3 support files for boards and processors
	    that do not have an MMU to support running the Linux kernel
	    have been removed.
          </span>
	  
	  These changes are intended to simplify processor and board
	  selection.
	  
        </p><p><b>C++ named operators bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to crash in
          some cases when the C++ operators <code class="code">and_eq</code>,
          <code class="code">bitand</code>, <code class="code">bitor</code>, <code class="code">compl</code>,
          <code class="code">not_eq</code>, <code class="code">or_eq</code> and
          <code class="code">xor_eq</code> were used in contexts where the
          preprocessor converts their names to strings.
        </p><p><b>Debug information for anonymous structure types. </b>
          A GCC bug in the generation of debug information for anonymous structure
          types in C++ code has been fixed.  The bug caused
          printing the type information for such structures in the debugger (via the
          <span class="command"><strong>ptype</strong></span> command) to fail with an error message.
        </p><p><b><code class="function">timer_delete</code> bug. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused some programs to crash or
          hang after calling <code class="function">timer_delete</code>.
        </p><p><b>Linker errors on non-ELF input. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused internal errors from the
          linker when linking non-ELF input files (with the
          <code class="option">-b</code> or <code class="option">--format</code> linker
          options).
        </p><p><b>Undefined weak references in shared libraries. </b>
          A linker bug has been fixed affecting calls from Thumb code
          in shared libraries to functions that are undefined weak
          references when the shared library is linked.  Such calls
          executed as nops whether or not the functions were defined
          at run time.
          <span>
            This affected thread-related code in the Thumb-2 versions
            of the standard C++ library provided with Sourcery G++,
            causing some multithreaded C++ programs to crash.
          </span>
        </p><p><b>Improved code generation. </b>
          The compiler has been improved to generate better code for
          an integer multiplication whose result feeds into an
          addition.
        </p><p><b>Installer fails during upgrade. </b>
	  The Sourcery G++ installer for Microsoft Windows hosts could
	  fail during an upgrade while waiting for the previous
	  version to be uninstalled.  This bug has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Performance improvements. </b>

          The uninstaller could be incorrectly deleted during an
          upgrade on Microsoft Windows hosts.  This bug has been
          fixed.
        </p><p><b>Remote debugging connection auto-retry. </b>
	  The <span class="command"><strong>target remote</strong></span> command within GDB now uses
	  a configurable auto-retry timeout when establishing TCP connections.
	  This is useful in avoiding race conditions when the remote
	  GDB stub or GDB server is launched simultaneously with GDB.
	  The auto-retry behavior is enabled by default; refer to the
	  GDB manual for details.
        </p><p><b><code class="literal">CMP</code> Thumb-2 instruction. </b>
	 The assembler no longer issues an error about
	 <code class="literal">CMP</code> instructions in which the second
	 argument is the stack pointer (<code class="literal">r13</code>), as
	 these are valid instructions.  However, use of the stack

          A bug has been fixed that caused internal compiler errors when
          compiling code using NEON types at least 32 bytes wide.
        </p><p><b>Temporary files on Microsoft Windows. </b>
	  On Microsoft Windows hosts, Sourcery G++ Lite now uses the standard
	  Windows algorithm to choose the directory in which to place
	  temporary files.  This change eliminates a crash that
	  occurred if none of the <code class="envar">TEMP</code>,
	  <code class="envar">TMP</code>, or <code class="envar">TMPDIR</code> variables were
	  set to a suitable directory.
        </p><p><b>Vectorized shift fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect code for loops

          Several ARM EABI 2.07 conformance issues relating to the
          handling of build attributes in the assembler and linker have
          been fixed.  All build attribute types are now recognized,
          and can now be declared by name, in addition to by number.
          Support for merging attributes in the linker has been improved,
          and the linking of incompatible objects is now detected and

        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 assembler fixes. </b>
	  The Thumb-2 encodings of <code class="code">QADD</code>,
	  <code class="code">QDADD</code>, <code class="code">QSUB</code>, and
	  <code class="code">QDSUB</code> have been corrected.  Previous versions

	  <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span> command can display error messages
	  with source locations for input files containing DWARF 3
	  debugging information.
	</p><p><b>NEON improvements. </b>
          Several improvements and bug fixes have been made to the
          NEON Advanced SIMD Extension support in GCC.  A problem that
          caused the autovectorizer to fail in some circumstances has
          been fixed.  Also, many of the intrinsics available via the
          <code class="filename">arm_neon.h</code> header file
          now have improved error checking for out-of-bounds arguments,
          and the <code class="code">vget_lane</code> intrinsics that return signed
          values now produce improved code.
        </p><p><b>NEON compiler fix. </b>
	  A compiler bug that resulted in incorrect NEON code being
	  generated has been fixed.  Typically the incorrect code
	  occurred when NEON intrinsics were used inside small
	  <code class="code">if</code> statements.
        </p><p><b>Connecting to the target using a pipe. </b>
	  A bug in GDB's
	  <span class="command"><strong>target remote | <em class="replaceable"><code>program</code></em></strong></span>
	  command has been fixed.  When launching the specified
	  <em class="replaceable"><code>program</code></em> failed, the bug caused
	  GDB to crash, hang, or give a message
	  <code class="literal">Error: No Error</code>.
	  
	  
	</p><p><b>Mixed-case NEON register aliases. </b>
	  An assembler bug that prevented NEON register aliases from being
	  created with mixed-case names using the <code class="code">.dn</code> and
	  <code class="code">.qn</code> directives has been fixed.  Previously only
	  aliases created with all-lowercase or all-uppercase names
	  worked correctly.
	</p><p><b>Janus 2CC support. </b>
          GCC now includes a work-around for a hardware bug in Avalent
	  Janus 2CC cores.  To compile and link for these cores, use
	  the <code class="option">-mfix-janus-2cc</code> compiler option.  If
	  you are using the linker directly use the
          <code class="option">--fix-janus-2cc</code> linker option.
        </p><p><b>ARM exception handling bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in the runtime library has been fixed that formerly
	  caused throwing an unexpected exception in C++ to crash
	  instead of calling the unexpected exception handler.  The
	  bug only affected C++ code compiled by non-GNU compilers
	  such as ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®.
	</p><p><b>Mangling of NEON type names. </b>
	  A bug in the algorithm used by the C++ compiler for mangling
	  the names of NEON types, such as <span class="type">int8x16_t</span>, has
	  been fixed.  These mangled names are used internally in
	  object files to encode type information in addition to the
	  programmer-visible names of the C++ variables and functions.
	  The new mangled name encoding is more compact and conforms
	  to the ARM C++ ABI.
        </p><p><b>Errors after loading the debugged program. </b>
          An intermittent GDB bug has been fixed.  The bug could cause

	  The assembler now accepts both uppercase and lowercase operands
	  for the <code class="code">IT</code> family of instructions.
        </p><p><b>NEON autovectorizer fix. </b>
	  A compiler bug that caused generation of bad <code class="code">VLD1</code>
	  instructions has been fixed. The bug affected code compiled with
	  <code class="option">-mfpu=neon -ftree-vectorize</code>.
        </p><p><b>Remote debugging improvements. </b>
	  The <span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span> utility now supports a more
	  efficient communications protocol that can reduce latency during
	  remote debugging.  The protocol optimizations are enabled
	  automatically when <span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span> operates over
	  a TCP connection.  Refer to the GDB manual for more information.
        </p><p><b>Output files removed on error. </b>
	  When GCC encounters an error, it now consistently removes
	  any incomplete output files that it may have created.
        </p><p><b>ARMv7 offset out of range errors. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in
	  <code class="literal">offset out of range</code> errors when compiling for
	  ARMv7 processors has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 <code class="code">MUL</code> encoding. </b>
          In Thumb-2 mode, the assembler now encodes <code class="code">MUL</code>
          as a 16-bit instruction (rather than as a 32-bit
          instruction) when possible.  This fix results in smaller
	  code, with no loss of performance.
        </p><p><b>ARM C++ ABI utility functions. </b>
          Vector utility functions required by the ARM C++ ABI no
          longer crash when passed null pointers.  The affected
          functions are <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_dtor_cookie</code>,
          <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_delete</code>,
          <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_delete3</code>, and

          <span>
	   In addition, on GNU/Linux systems, the ARM C++ ABI utility
	   functions are now exported from the
	   <code class="filename">libstdc++.so</code> shared library.  
          </span>
	  These functions are not intended for use by application
	  programmers; they are only called by compiler-generated
	  code.  They are not presently used by the GNU C++ compiler,
	  but are used by some other compilers, including ARM's

        </p><p><b>Smaller Thumb-2 code. </b>
          When optimizing for size (i.e., when <code class="option">-Os</code> is
	  in use), GCC now generates the 16-bit <code class="code">MULS</code>
	  Thumb-2 multiply instruction instead of the 32-bit
	  <code class="code">MUL</code> instruction.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 <code class="code">RBIT</code> encoding. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in incorrect encoding of the
	  Thumb-2 <code class="code">RBIT</code> instruction has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Sprite communication improvements. </b>
	  The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite now uses a more efficient protocol

	  A linker error that resulted in incorrect offsets when processing
	  relocations on <code class="code">MOVW</code> and <code class="code">MOVT</code> instructions
	  referencing mergeable string sections has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Improved argument-passing code. </b>
          The compiler can now generate more efficient code for
	  certain functions whose arguments must be sign-extended
	  to conform with language or ABI conventions.
	  The required conversion was formerly being performed both 
          in the called function and at all call sites; now the redundant

          A bug where the linker produces an incorrect error message
          with segments at the top of the address space has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GCC stack size limit increased. </b>
          On Windows hosts, the maximum stack size for the GCC

          format strings with very large precision values such as
          <code class="code">%1.300000000s</code>, and with some invalid format
          strings.
        </p><p><b>Invalid object file after strip. </b>
	 A bug in the assembler has been fixed that formerly caused
	 <code class="literal">.set <em class="replaceable"><code>symbol</code></em>
	 <em class="replaceable"><code>expression</code></em></code>
	 constructs to emit <em class="replaceable"><code>symbol</code></em> in the
	 wrong section.  This in turn caused inconsistent behavior
	 after stripping the symbol table. 
        </p><p><b>GCC update. </b>
	  The GCC package has been updated to version 4.2.3.  This version
	  includes numerous bug fixes since GCC 4.2.
	</p><p><b>License checking on Linux. </b>
          Sourcery G++'s license-checking logic now includes a workaround 
          for a kernel bug present in some versions of Linux.  This bug 
          formerly caused failures with an error message from the 
          <code class="literal">cs-license</code> component.
        </p><p><b>Cortex-R4F and VFPv3-D16. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now supports the ARM Cortex-R4F CPU
	  and the VFPv3-D16 floating-point coprocessor.  These can
	  be selected with <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-r4f</code> and
	  <code class="option">-mfpu=vfpv3-d16</code>, respectively.
        </p><p><b>Overlapping operands for long multiply instructions. </b>
	  An incorrect assembler warning has been removed in the case of
	  overlapping source and destination operands for
	  <code class="code">UMULL</code>, <code class="code">SMULL</code>, <code class="code">UMLAL</code>
	  and <code class="code">SMLAL</code> instructions on ARMv6 processors.
        </p><p><b>Size optimization bug. </b>
	  A code generation bug that caused corruption of function
	  arguments when compiling with <code class="option">-Os</code> has been
	  fixed.  The corruption occurred as part of the sibling call
	  optimization.
        </p><p><b>C++ library ABI fix. </b>
          GCC 4.2.1's <code class="code">std::type_info</code> was not fully
          compatible with earlier versions.  The ordering of four
          virtual functions has been fixed in this update.
	</p><p><b>Improved gdbserver thread support. </b>
	  The GNU/Linux remote debug agent,
	  <span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span>, no longer fails when two
	  threads call <code class="function">pthread_create</code> at the same
	  time.  It also supports limited thread debugging when
	  symbols for <code class="filename">libpthread.so</code> are not
	  available.
	</p><p><b>GDB support for user-defined prefixed commands. </b>
	  The GDB <span class="command"><strong>define</strong></span> and
	  <span class="command"><strong>document</strong></span> commands, which allow you to
	  add new commands to the GDB command-line interface, now
	  support creating commands within an existing prefix
	  such as <span class="command"><strong>target</strong></span>.  Hooks for prefixed
	  commands are also supported.  Refer to the Debugger manual
	  for more information.
	</p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
          6.7.20080107.  This update includes numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>UNC pathname bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused linker errors on Windows
          hosts when running a Sourcery G++ toolchain installed in a UNC
          path
          (<code class="filename">\\<em class="replaceable"><code>host</code></em>\<em class="replaceable"><code>directory</code></em></code>).
        </p><p><b>Linker crash on invalid input files. </b>
          Some older versions of GCC generated object files with
          invalid mergeable string sections when compiling with
          <code class="option">-fmerge-all-constants</code>.  This bug was fixed
          in Sourcery G++ as of version 4.1-43.  However, since system
          libraries included with some GNU/Linux distributions were
          affected by this bug, the linker has now been changed to
          accept object files with such invalid sections, rather than
          crash or produce an error message.
        </p><p><b>GDB search path bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that formerly resulted in an internal
	  error when setting <code class="varname">solib-search-path</code> or
	  <code class="varname">solib-absolute-prefix</code> after establishing a
	  connection to a remote target.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated to version
	  2.18.50.20080215 from the FSF trunk.  This update includes
	  numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Race fixes in <code class="function">setuid</code>. </b>
	  Several bugs in multi-threaded <code class="function">setuid</code>
	  have been fixed.  The bugs led to threads with incorrect
	  privileges and hangs at thread exit.  The
	  <code class="function">setgid</code>, <code class="function">seteuid</code>,
	  <code class="function">setegid</code>, <code class="function">setreuid</code>,
	  <code class="function">setregid</code>,
	  <code class="function">setresuid</code>, and
	  <code class="function">setresgid</code> functions were also affected.
        </p><p><b><span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span> support for execution wrappers. </b>
	  <span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span> has a new command-line option,
	  <code class="option">--wrapper</code>, which specifies a wrapper for any
	  programs run by <span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span>.  The specified wrapper can
	  prepare the system and environment for the new program.
        </p><p><b>Read-only variables. </b>
         The C++ compiler now places variables whose types are
         instantiations of template classes in a read-only data
         section if they are declared <code class="code">const</code> and
         initialized with a constant value.  This changes reduces the
         RAM usage of affected applications.
        </p><p><b>CodeSourcery Common Startup Code Sequence. </b>
          Support for CS3, a unified startup scheme is included.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id282758"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2007q3-51</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Volatile postincrement and postdecrement bug fix. </b>
          A code generation bug that caused postincrement or
          postdecrement of a volatile object to reread the modified
          value from that object in some contexts has been fixed.  The
          bug affected code performing a comparison of the
          postincrement or postdecrement expression with a constant,
          or that was optimized to comparison with a constant.
        </p><p><b>Support for debugging with FlashPro3. </b>
          Support has been added for debugging with the Actel FlashPro3 JTAG
	  device on Windows hosts.  This works only with Actel Cortex-M1 FPGAs.
        </p><p><b>C++ class debug information. </b>
          The flag <code class="option">-femit-class-debug-always</code> 
          is now disabled by default. The flag produces 
          duplicate C++ class debug information as a 
          work-around for older debuggers. 
        </p><p><b>Improved breakpoints in constructors and template functions. </b>
          GDB now supports breakpoints on source code locations 
          that have several code addresses associated with them.
          Setting a breakpoint on a constructor automatically associates
          the breakpoint with all constructor bodies generated by GCC.  
          If you set a breakpoint on a line of a templated function, GDB
          breaks at the indicated line in all instantiations of the
          templated function. 
        </p><p><b>GDB <span class="command"><strong>printf</strong></span> %p. </b>
          GDB's <span class="command"><strong>printf</strong></span> command now supports the
	  <code class="literal">"%p"</code> format specifier.
        </p><p><b>Widening multiply instructions for ARMv6 and later. </b>
          GCC now makes use of the 32-to-64-bit widening multiply instructions
          (<code class="code">umull</code>, <code class="code">smull</code>, <code class="code">umlal</code>, and
          <code class="code">smlal</code>) when generating code for ARMv6 and later.
          A bug had caused these instructions to be used for ARMv3 to
          ARMv5 only.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
          The included version of GDB has been updated to
          6.6.20070821.  This update includes numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Assembler code file name suffixes. </b>
          GCC now recognizes <code class="filename">.sx</code> as well as
          <code class="filename">.S</code> as a file name suffix indicating
          assembler code which must be preprocessed.  
          The alternate suffix may be useful in conjunction with other
          program development tools on Windows that do not distinguish
          case on filenames and treat <code class="filename">.S</code> the same
          as <code class="filename">.s</code>, which GCC uses to indicate assembler
          code without preprocessing.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id282974"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2007q3-33</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Preprocessing assembly code. </b>
          The compiler driver passes <code class="option">-I</code> options to the
          assembler, so that <code class="code">#include</code> directives
          (processed by the preprocessor) and <code class="code">.include</code>
          directives (processed by the assembler) use the same search
          path.
        </p><p><b>Dynamically-initialized <code class="code">const</code> variables. </b>
          Dynamically-initialized namespace-scope C++ variables are no
	  longer placed in read-only data sections, even when marked
	  <code class="code">const</code>.  These variables must be modified at
	  startup, so they cannot be placed in ROM, even though their
	  values cannot change once initialized.
        </p><p><b>Register allocation bug fix. </b>
	  A register allocation bug has been fixed.  Under rare 
	  circumstances, the bug caused incorrect code generation.
        </p><p><b>iWMMXt bug fix. </b>
          A GCC bug affecting code generation for iWMMXt processors
          has been fixed.  The bug caused internal compiler errors
          when compiling some functions with large stack frames.
        </p><p><b>NEON coprocessor system registers. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts the <code class="literal">MVFR0</code> and
	  <code class="literal">MVFR1</code> coprocessor registers in
	  <code class="code">fmrx</code> and <code class="code">fmxr</code> instructions.
        </p><p><b>Disabling diagnostics for use of system header and
        library directories. </b>
          The warnings for use of options such as
          <code class="option">-I/usr/include</code> when cross compiling can be
          disabled with a new option
          <code class="option">-Wno-poison-system-directories</code>.  This
          option is intended for use in chroot environments when such
          directories contain the correct headers and libraries for
          the target system rather than the host.
        </p><p><b>Default linker script. </b>
	  GCC no longer uses the simulator linker script by default.
	  To avoid a link failure, you must specify a linker script
	  explicitly with the <code class="option">-T</code> command-line option,
	  or via the <span class="guisubmenu">Properties</span> item on the
	  <span class="guimenu">Project</span> menu in the Sourcery G++ IDE.
        </p><p><b>Debugging of statically-linked threaded programs. </b>
          GDB and EGLIBC now support thread debugging when using GCC's
          <code class="option">-static</code> option.  Existing statically-linked
          programs must be relinked after upgrading EGLIBC for this
          fix.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 doubleword writeback addressing modes. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused writeback addressing modes for
	  <code class="literal">ldrd</code> and <code class="literal">strd</code> to be
	  incorrectly encoded has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Stricter check for anonymous unions. </b>
          G++ now issues an error about invalid code that uses the
	  same name for a member of an anonymous union and an entity
	  in the surrounding namespace.  For example, you will now
	  get an error about code like:
	  </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">int i;
static union { int i; };</pre></div><p>
	  because both the global variable and the anonymous union
	  member are named <code class="literal">i</code>.  To make this code
	  valid you must change one of the declarations to use a
	  different name.
        </p><p><b>GCC update. </b>
	  The GCC package has been updated to version 4.2.1.  This version
	  includes numerous bug fixes since GCC 4.2.
	</p><p><b>Smaller code for C++ destructors. </b>
          G++ now generates more compact code to handle the
	  destruction of C++ objects declared at namespace scope or
	  declared within a function scope using the
	  <code class="code">static</code> keyword.
        </p><p><b>Robustness on Microsoft Windows. </b>
          Defects that sometimes caused GDB to become non-responsive
          on Microsoft Windows have been eliminated.
        </p><p><b>Debug information for thread-local variables. </b>
          GCC now generates accurate debug information for
          thread-local variables.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
          The binutils package has been updated to the 2007-08-19
	  version of the pre-2.18 FSF trunk.  This contains many
	  new improvements and bug fixes.  For more information,
	  refer to the manuals for the individual utilities, and
	  to the binutils web site at
	  <code class="uri">http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/</code>.
        </p><p><b>Debugging information fix. </b>
          GCC no longer generates invalid debugging information for
          sections with no contents.  The invalid debugging
          information caused the GNU/Linux prelinker to crash.
        </p><p><b>Calls to undefined weak symbols. </b>
	  The linker now implements semantics that comply to the ARM EABI for
	  <code class="literal">R_ARM_CALL</code> and <code class="literal">T_ARM_THM_CALL</code>
	  relocations against undefined weak symbols.  These now result
	  in a jump to the next instruction.
        </p><p><b>Thread synchronization no longer uses <code class="code">swp</code>. </b>
          All of the thread synchronization functions (such as
          <code class="function">pthread_mutex_lock</code>) have been changed to
	  avoid using the <code class="code">swp</code> instruction.  This instruction
	  is deprecated in ARM V6 and executes very slowly on recent CPUs.
	  Instead, the synchronization functions now use kernel-provided
	  instruction sequences that are optimal for the processor in use.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 shift instruction aliases. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts <code class="literal">mov</code> with shifted
	  operands as an alias for Thumb-2 shift instructions.
	  For example <code class="code">mov r0, r1, lsl r2</code> is encoded as
	  <code class="code">lsl r0, r1, r2</code>.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 branches to shared libraries. </b>
	  The linker can now generate PLT stubs for
	  <code class="literal">R_ARM_THM_JUMP24</code> and
	  <code class="literal">R_ARM_THM_JUMP19</code> relocations.
	  This occurs when Thumb-2 branch instructions refer to
	  symbols imported from shared libraries.
        </p><p><b>Inlined function debugging fix. </b>
	  GDB now backtraces correctly when stopped at the first
	  instruction of an inlined function.  Earlier versions would
	  sometimes encounter internal errors in this situation.
        </p><p><b>Assembler skipping <code class="literal">\</code> characters. </b>
          A bug is fixed where the assembler would skip <code class="literal">\</code>
          characters when they appeared at certain positions in the
          input file.  This bug primarily affected assembler macros.
        </p><p><b>Improved diagnostics for region overflow. </b>
          The linker will now give more helpful diagnostics when
	  the object files being linked are too big for one of the
	  memory regions defined in the linker script.
        </p><p><b>EABI object attribute merging. </b>
          The linker now properly merges EABI object attributes into
          its output file.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 exception return instructions. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused <code class="code">subs pc, lr, #const</code> and
	  <code class="code">movs pc, lr</code> to be incorrectly encoded has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t object attributes. </b>
	  Objects generated with <code class="option">-fshort-wchar</code> are
	  now given the correct <code class="literal">Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t</code>
	  EABI object attribute annotations.
        </p><p><b>Spurious compiler warnings eliminated. </b>
          GCC no longer emits warnings when linker-specific
          command-line options are provided in combination with modes
          that do not perform linking, such as with the
          <code class="option">-c</code> flag.
        </p><p><b>Debugging of inlined functions. </b>
	  GDB now supports inlined functions.  GDB can include inlined
	  functions in the stack trace; display inlined functions' arguments
	  and local variables; and step into, over, and out of inlined
	  functions.
        </p><p><b>Uppercase special register names. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts both uppercase and lowercase
	  special register names when assembling <code class="literal">msr</code>
	  and <code class="literal">mrs</code> instructions for the Microcontroller
	  profile of the ARM Architecture.
        </p><p><b>Debugger access to out-of-bounds memory. </b>
          GDB turns on <code class="code">inaccessible-by-default</code> by
          default, disallowing access to memory outside the regions
          specified in a board configuration.
        </p><p><b>Call shortening bug fix. </b>
	  GCC no longer overrides <code class="code">__attribute__((long_call))</code> on
	  calls to locally-defined functions when the function is weak,
	  or when it is in a different section from the caller.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated from 
	  version 2.17 to the pre-2.18 FSF trunk.  This is a significant
	  update with many improvements and bug fixes.
        </p><p>
	Changes to the assembler (<span class="command"><strong>as</strong></span>) include:

      </p><p>
	New linker (<span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span>) features include:

          </li><li>
            There are new command-line options
            <code class="option">-Bsymbolic-functions</code>,
            <code class="option">--dynamic-list</code>,
            <code class="option">--dynamic-list-cpp-new</code>, and
            <code class="option">--dynamic-list-data</code> to control symbols
            that should be dynamically linked.
          </li><li>
            The new <code class="option">--print-gc-sections</code> option lists
            sections removed by garbage collection.

      </p><p>
	Other changes include:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
            The <span class="command"><strong>objcopy</strong></span> utility has a new
            <code class="option">--extract-symbol</code> option to extract only
            symbol table information from the input file.
          </li><li>
            The <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> utility now allows input files

          The included version of GDB has been updated to
          6.6.50.20070620.  This update includes numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Thread cancellation bug fix. </b>
          A bug in EGLIBC causing thread cancellation to fail when
          running under Linux kernels 2.6.18 and later has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Forced alignment of array variables. </b>
	  A new option <code class="option">-falign-arrays</code> has been added to
	  the compiler.  Specifying this option sets the minimum alignment
	  for array variables to be the largest power of two less than or
	  equal to their total storage size, or the biggest alignment used
	  on the machine, whichever is smaller.  This option may be helpful
	  when compiling legacy code that uses type punning on arrays that
	  does not strictly conform to the C standard.
	</p><p><b>ARM EABI compliance. </b>
	 Objects produced by Sourcery G++ are now marked as ARM ELF 
	 version 5 rather than ARM ELF version 4.  This reflects 
	 compliance with recent revisions of the ARM EABI.
	 Sourcery G++ still accepts objects marked with version 4.
	</p><p><b>Smaller C++ applications. </b>
          The C++ runtime library has been modified so that using
          namespace-scope objects with destructors does not pull in
          unnecessary support functions.  Therefore, statically linked
          C++ applications compiled with
          <code class="option">-fno-exceptions</code> are substantially smaller.
        </p><p><b>ARMv6-M floating-point bug fix. </b>
          A bug affecting conversion of wider floating-point types to
          subnormal <span class="type">float</span> values on ARMv6-M processors
          has been fixed.

          directories contain the correct headers and libraries for
          the target system rather than the host.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 doubleword writeback addressing modes. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused writeback addressing modes for
	  <code class="literal">ldrd</code> and <code class="literal">strd</code> to be
	  incorrectly encoded has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 shift instruction aliases. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts <code class="literal">mov</code> with shifted
	  operands as an alias for Thumb-2 shift instructions.
	  For example <code class="code">mov r0, r1, lsl r2</code> is encoded as
	  <code class="code">lsl r0, r1, r2</code>.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 branches to shared libraries. </b>
	  The linker can now generate PLT stubs for
	  <code class="literal">R_ARM_THM_JUMP24</code> and
	  <code class="literal">R_ARM_THM_JUMP19</code> relocations.
	  This occurs when Thumb-2 branch instructions refer to
	  symbols imported from shared libraries.
        </p><p><b>EABI object attribute merging. </b>
          The linker now properly merges EABI object attributes into
          its output file.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 exception return instructions. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused <code class="code">subs pc, lr, #const</code> and
	  <code class="code">movs pc, lr</code> to be incorrectly encoded has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t object attributes. </b>
	  Objects generated with <code class="option">-fshort-wchar</code> are
	  now given the correct <code class="literal">Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t</code>
	  EABI object attribute annotations.
        </p><p><b>Uppercase special register names. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts both uppercase and lowercase
	  special register names when assembling <code class="literal">msr</code>
	  and <code class="literal">mrs</code> instructions for the Microcontroller
	  profile of the ARM Architecture.

	  A bug in the disassembler that caused code to be displayed 
	  as data (and vice-versa) in files with overlapping sections has 
	  been fixed.  This mainly affects the <span class="command"><strong>objdump</strong></span> 
	  utility.
        </p><p><b>Installer hangs while refreshing environment. </b>
          The Sourcery G++ installer for Microsoft Windows
          now updates the <code class="envar">PATH</code> environment 
          variable without waiting for open applications to 
          acknowledge the update. This change prevents open 
          applications from blocking the installer's progress.
        </p><p><b>Improved assembler diagnostics for 8-bit offsets. </b>
          The assembler now correctly diagnoses out-of-range offsets to
	  instructions such as <code class="literal">LDRD</code> as 8-bit rather
	  than half-word offsets.
        </p><p><b>Less disk space required for installation. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite packages are smaller because multiple copies of files
          have been replaced with hard and/or symbolic links when possible.
          Both the size of the installer images and the amount of disk space
          required for an installed package have been reduced.
        </p><p><b>Thumb register corruption fix. </b>
	  A bug in the compiler that could cause register corruption in
	  Thumb mode has been fixed.  The compiler was formerly emitting
	  code to restore registers on function return that was not
	  interrupt safe.
        </p><p><b>__aeabi_lcmp. </b>
	  An error in the libgcc implementation of
	  <code class="function">__aeabi_lcmp</code> that caused
	  incorrect results to be returned has been fixed.  This is a support
	  routine defined by the ARM EABI.  GCC does not normally use this
	  routine directly, however it may be used by third-party code.
        </p><p><b>The <code class="literal">\@</code> assembler pseudo-variable. </b>
	  A bug in the assembler that caused uses of the <code class="literal">\@</code>
	  pseudo-variable to be mis-parsed as comments has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Crash when generating vector code. </b>
	  A bug that sometimes caused the compiler to crash when invoked with 
	  the <code class="option">-ftree-vectorize</code> option has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Propagation of Thumb symbol attributes. </b>
          Symbols referring to Thumb functions on ARM targets now
	  have their Thumb attribute correctly propagated to any aliases
	  defined with <code class="literal">.set</code> or <code class="literal">.symver</code>. 
        </p><p><b>Linking of non-ELF images. </b>
          A linker bug that could cause a crash when linking non-ELF
	  objects for ARM targets has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Invalid load instructions. </b>
	  A bug in the compiler which caused it to generate invalid
	  assembly (e.g. <code class="literal">ldrd r0, [#0, r2]</code>)
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>VFPv3/NEON debug information. </b>
	  A bug in the compiler which caused it to generate incorrect debug
	  information for code using VFPv3/NEON registers has been fixed.
	  The debugger is now able unable to locate and display
	  values held in these registers.
        </p><p><b>ARMv6-M system instructions. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused some ARMv6-M system instructions to
	  be incorrectly rejected has been fixed.  The affected instructions
	  are <code class="literal">msr</code>, <code class="literal">mrs</code>,
	  <code class="literal">yield</code>, <code class="literal">wfi</code>,
	  <code class="literal">wfe</code> and <code class="literal">sev</code>.
        </p><p><b>Assembly of Thumb-2 load/store multiple instructions. </b>
	  The Thumb-2 <code class="literal">ldm</code> and <code class="literal">stm</code>
	  assembly mnemonics are now assembled to <code class="literal">ldr</code>
	  and <code class="literal">str</code> instructions when a single register is
	  transferred, as specified in the Thumb-2 Architecture Supplement.
        </p><p><b>Conditional Thumb-2 branch instructions. </b>
	  A linker bug that could cause objects involving conditional
	  Thumb-2 branch instructions to be incorrectly rejected has
	  been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Alignment bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that formerly caused incorrect code to be
          generated in some situations for copying structure arguments
          being passed by value.  The incorrect code caused alignment 
          errors on stack accesses on some targets.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id284617"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2007q1-3</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Thumb-2 runtime libraries. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now includes runtime libraries built as Thumb-2 code
	  for use on ARMv7 systems.  These can be found in the
	  <code class="filename">libc/thumb2/</code> directory.
        </p><p><b>Marvell Feroceon support. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite now generates code optimized for Marvell Feroceon CPUs
          when the <code class="option">mcpu=marvell-f</code> option is specified.  
          This option also selects runtime libraries optimized for 
          this processor.
        </p><p><b>Assembly of SRS instructions. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in incorrect encoding of the
	  Thumb-2 <code class="literal">SRS</code> instruction has been fixed.
	  In addition the assembler supports explicit specification of
	  the base register, as accepted by other ARM toolchains.
        </p><p><b>VFP disassembly crash. </b>
	  A bug that caused crashes when disassembling some forms of the VFP
	  <code class="literal">fmrx</code> and <code class="literal">fmxr</code> instructions
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Improved debugging for optimized code. </b>
          GDB's ability to print and change variables' values in
          optimized code is improved.  GDB now tracks variable scopes
          more accurately, making better use of the detailed debugging
          information produced by Sourcery G++ compilers.
        </p><p><b>Improved handling of Windows paths in GDB. </b>
          GDB now properly recognizes the names of source files that
          were passed to the compiler using an absolute path on
          Windows.  You may refer to the file either by its base
          name (without any leading directory components), by the
          exact path passed to the compiler, or by its absolute
          path.
        </p><p><b>ARM Cortex-R4 performance improvements. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ Lite now generates faster code when compiling for the
	  ARM Cortex-R4 processor by scheduling instructions for the
	  processor's pipelines.  To generate code
	  for this processor, use the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-r4</code>
	  command-line option.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
          The included version of GDB has been updated to
          6.6.50.20070228.  This update includes numerous bug fixes
          and improved support for C++ pointers to members.
        </p><p><b>Assembling Thumb store-multiple instructions. </b>
          The assembler now issues an error message instead of crashing on
          load/store multiple instructions that incorrectly use Thumb-2
          addressing modes (e.g., <code class="literal">ldmdb</code>) in legacy Thumb
          syntax mode.  If you want to use these address modes, you should use
          unified syntax mode instead.
        </p><p><b>ARM Cortex-A8 performance improvements. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ Lite now generates faster code when compiling for the
	  ARM Cortex-A8 processor by scheduling instructions for the
	  processor's dual-issue pipelines.  To generate code
	  for this processor, use the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-a8</code>
	  command-line option.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.2. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM GNU/Linux is now based on GCC version 4.2.
	  For more information about changes from GCC version 4.1 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.2/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Fix --gc-sections and C++ exceptions. </b>
	  A bug in the <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> linker option has been
	  fixed.  Previously this would incorrectly remove unwinding tables,
	  breaking C++ applications that use exceptions.
        </p><p><b>Symbols defined in linker scripts. </b> A bug is fixed that caused the linker to crash in some
          circumstances when a linker script defined a symbol in an output
          section.  Typically usage is where the script contained a
          <code class="literal">__DATA_LOAD = LOADADDR(.data)</code> statement in the
          <code class="literal">.data</code> section.  </p><p><b>ARM NEON store intrinsics bug fix. </b>
          A compiler bug that incorrectly caused calls to ARM NEON
          store intrinsics (such as <code class="literal">vst1_u8</code>) to be
          optimized away has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Improvements to ARM NEON support. </b>
          The ARM NEON support in GCC has been enhanced to comply with
          new rules for containerized vector types specified in the
          ARM procedure call standard.  Additionally, the compiler now
          rejects implicit conversions between NEON polynomial vector
          types and NEON integer vector types of the same layout.
        </p><p><b>Complex numbers bug fix. </b>
          A bug that could lead to incorrect code generation for code
          using complex numbers has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Use of system header and library directories diagnosed. </b>
          The compiler and linker now diagnose the incorrect use of
          native system header and library directories for
          cross-compilation.  This typically arises from options such
          as <code class="option">-I/usr/X11R6/include</code> hard-coded in build
          scripts written without a view to cross-compilation.
        </p><p><b>Initialization priorities. </b>
          The <code class="code">constructor</code> and
	  <code class="code">destructor</code> function attributes now accept
	  an optional priority argument.  Constructors with small
	  priorities are run before those with larger priorities; the
	  opposite is true for destructors.  For example:
	  </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">void f __attribute__((constructor(500)));
void f() {
  /* Perform initialization.  */
}</pre></div><p>
	  defines a function <code class="function">f</code> with priority
	  500.  This function will be run before constructors with
	  larger priorities.  Constructor and destructors with no
	  explicit priority argument have priority 65535, the maximum
	  permitted value.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 IT block code generation error fixed. </b>
	  A bug in Thumb-2 code generation has been fixed.  This bug would
	  result in missing IT instructions, causing the assembler to
	  reject the code.
        </p><p><b>iWMMXt compiler errors. </b>
	  A compiler bug that caused invalid assembly when generating
	  iWMMXt code has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 stack decrement misassembly. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in incorrect encoding of the
	  32-bit Thumb-2 form of the <code class="literal">sub sp, sp, #const</code>
	  instruction has been fixed.  Previously this was misassembled as
	  <code class="literal">subs</code>.
        </p><p><b>Naked functions. </b>
          Functions marked with <code class="code">__attribute__((naked))</code>
          no longer contain prologue and epilogue code.
          Please refer to the GCC manual for the proper use of this
          attribute.
        </p><p><b>Destructor execution order. </b>
          Prioritized destructors (whether specified with the
          <code class="code">destructor</code> function attribute in C or the
          <code class="code">init_priority</code> variable attribute in C++)
          are now executed in the correct order.  Previous releases
          ran the destructors in an indeterminate order.
        </p><p><b>Fix addr2line defect. </b>
          The binary utility <span class="command"><strong>addr2line</strong></span> now
	  operates correctly on 64-bit targets with DWARF2
	  debug information.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 assembler infinite loop. </b>
          An assembler bug that would cause it to enter an infinite loop
	  when processing some Thumb-2 assembly has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Assembler warnings about overlapping multiplication operands. </b>
          The assembler no longer warns about overlapping <code class="literal">Rd</code>
	  and <code class="literal">Rm</code> operands when assembling
          <code class="literal">mul</code> and <code class="literal">mla</code> instructions
	  for the ARM architecture version six or above.
        </p><p><b>Improve handling of corrupt debug information. </b>
	  The binary utility <span class="command"><strong>readelf</strong></span> now
	  copes more gracefully with corrupted DWARF 2 information.
        </p><p><b>Smaller C++ programs. </b>
          Rarely-used functions in the C++ runtime library have been
          isolated into separate object files so that they will not be
          included unless needed.  As a result, most statically
          linked C++ programs are smaller.

          Implicit conversions between generic vector types are now
          only permitted when the two vectors in question have the same number
          of elements and compatible element types.  (Note that the restriction
          involves <span class="emphasis"><em>compatible</em></span> element types, not
          implicitly-convertible element types: thus, a vector type with element
          type <code class="code">int</code> may not be implicitly converted to a vector
          type with element type <code class="code">unsigned int</code>.)
          This restriction, which is in line with specifications for SIMD
          architectures such as AltiVec, may be relaxed using the
          flag <code class="option">-flax-vector-conversions</code>.
          This flag is intended only as a compatibility measure and should not
          be used for new code.
        </p><p><b><span class="type">type_info</span> comparison fix. </b>
          Comparison of <span class="type">type_info</span> objects now uses pointer
          comparison where possible.
        </p><p><b>C++ forced unwinding fixes. </b>
          Some bugs relating to forced unwinding through C++ code have
          been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Support for additional Stellaris boards. </b>
          Linker scripts are provided for the 6xx and 8xx series Stellaris
          boards.
        </p><p><b>Linux support for USB Debug Sprite. </b>
          A new driver is included to allow the Sourcery G++ Lite USB Debug Sprite 
          to run on Linux hosts.  See <a class="xref" href="chap-release.html" title="Chapter 3. Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM GNU/Linux">Chapter 3, <i>Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM GNU/Linux</i></a> for

          A bug is fixed where an erroneous linker script would cause a
          linker crash.  An error message is now produced.
        </p><p><b>Newlib memory use improvements. </b>
          The memory overhead of linking with newlib is reduced.
          Applications that use only a minimal set of library
          features may now require significantly less memory.

          The type-based alias analysis performed by the compiler when compiling
          with <code class="option">-O2</code> or with <code class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</code> is
          now more conservative.  The more aggressive analysis used in previous
          versions sometimes resulted in incorrect code generation.
        </p><p><b>Fully relocatable preprocessor. </b>
          When cross-compiling, the default preprocessor search path includes only 
          the directories present in the installed toolchain. This speeds up the 
          preprocessor and prevents the unintentional use of unrelated files and 
          directories on the machine where it is installed.

          Support has been added in binutils and the prelinker
          for new-style (also known as <code class="literal">DT_GNU_HASH</code>)
          symbol hashing.  This can dramatically speed up symbol
          resolution time and is particularly applicable in environments
          where full prelinking is not possible (for example where
          shared libraries are dynamically opened at
          runtime).  The new-style hashing may be enabled by passing
          <code class="option">--hash-style=gnu</code> to the linker.
        </p><p><b>Prelinker update. </b>
          The prelinker has been updated to the current

          GDB now determines ROM regions automatically from the memory map
          included in target configuration files.  This information is
          used to determine when hardware breakpoints should automatically
          be used (for instance the <span class="command"><strong>step</strong></span>,
          <span class="command"><strong>next</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>finish</strong></span> commands).
          Separate ROM configurations have been removed from the Eclipse
          debugger menu.  The Eclipse GUI has been extended to provide
          improved support for debugging programs in ROM, when a memory
          map is not automatically available.

          tools provided by other distributors.
        </p><p><b>iWMMXt bug fixes. </b>
          Some bugs involving incorrect code generation and internal
          compiler errors when generating iWMMXt code have been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Cortex-M3 startup code. </b>
          The ARMv7-M startup code (<code class="filename">armv7m-crt0.o</code>) incorrectly
          contained ARM code.  This has been replaced with Thumb-2 code.
        </p><p><b>ARM EABI coverage testing support. </b>
        Coverage testing using GCOV is now supported for the ARM EABI 
        target. Please refer to the

          The former USB Debug Stub, <span class="command"><strong>armswd</strong></span>, is now known as
          the USB Debug Sprite, and has been renamed to
          <span class="command"><strong>arm-stellaris-eabi-sprite</strong></span>.  In addition, its
          initialization sequence has been updated to recognize the r1p1 
          release of the Cortex-M3 processor.
        </p><p><b>Incompatible changes to Stellaris linker scripts. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite now supports linking executables to run from RAM as well
          as ROM.  As part of this change, there are now separate RAM and ROM
          versions of the linker scripts for each supported board, and the former
          ROM-based versions have been renamed.  For example, if you were 
          formerly linking with <code class="option">-T lm3s10x.ld</code>, you should now use
          <code class="option">-T lm3s10x-rom.ld</code> to get the same behavior.

          Eclipse configurations for debugging arm-none-eabi applications
          using the GDB simulator and remote debug stubs have been added.
        </p><p><b>iWMMXt2 support. </b>
          The assembler and disassembler now support iWMMXt2
          instructions.
        </p><p><b>NEON intrinsics support. </b>
          GCC now supports NEON intrinsics defined in the
          <code class="filename">arm_neon.h</code> header.
          These are the same intrinsics supported by the ARM 
	  <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®
          compiler and are documented in the 'ARM NEON Intrinsics'
          section of the GCC manual.

          Several problems with the linker scripts for bare-metal targets have
          been fixed.

          The binutils in this release is based on the final binutils 2.17
          release.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
          The included version of GDB has been upgraded to 6.5.50.20060822.
          This includes numerous bug fixes from the previous version.
        </p><p><b>GDB support for flash memory. </b>
          The GDB <span class="command"><strong>load</strong></span> command can now write to flash
          memory, if the remote debugging stub contains appropriate support.
        </p><p><b>Compiler support for NEON. </b>
          Initial GCC support for autovectorization and generation
          of NEON SIMD instructions has been added.
        </p><p><b>Bare metal Cortex-M3 configurations. </b>
          Bare metal configurations now support generating images for
          use on ARMv7-M devices (eg. Cortex-M3).
        </p><p><b>iWMMXt support in GLIBC. </b>
          GLIBC's <code class="function">setjmp</code> and
          <code class="function">longjmp</code> now support saving and restoring
          iWMMXt registers on hardware with those registers.  This
          requires a kernel reporting
          <code class="computeroutput">iwmmxt</code> in the
          <code class="computeroutput">Features</code> entry in
          <code class="filename">/proc/cpuinfo</code>.
        </p><p><b>iWMMXt exception handling support. </b>
          Exception handling now restores the values of iWMMXt registers
          correctly.
        </p><p><b>Corrected IPC functions. </b>
          A bug in GLIBC's <code class="function">msgctl</code>,
          <code class="function">semctl</code>, and <code class="function">shmctl</code>
          functions has been corrected.

          This release is based on GCC 4.1.1.
        </p><p><b>Fully relocatable compiler. </b>
          The compiler now searches for its components only in the directory where it
          has been installed, and no longer also searches pathnames matching the
          directory where it was configured.  This speeds up the compiler and prevents
          problems with unintentionally finding unrelated files or directories on the
          machine where it has been installed. 
        </p><p><b>Stack permission marking for ARM GNU/Linux. </b>
          Non-executable stacks can provide increased security against
          some forms of buffer overflow attacks. The tools involved must
          coordinate the annotation of required stack permissions, either
          executable, or non-executable.  For ARM GNU/Linux targets the
          compiler now outputs annotations indicating the required stack
          permissions.

          Using the Stabs debugging format (available with
          <code class="option">-gstabs</code> or <code class="option">-gstabs+</code>) now works
          in conjunction with <code class="option">-mthumb</code>.  CodeSourcery
          recommends the default DWARF debugging format (available with
          <code class="option">-g</code>) as DWARF is a more comprehensive debugging format.

          The linker scripts for 3xx Series CPUs now place the ISR vector
          at address zero, as required by all Cortex-M3 cores.
        </p><p><b>Stellaris USB Debug Sprite improvements. </b>
          Bug fixes and new features include:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
            A bug that caused the stub not to correctly update the program counter 
            and other register values was fixed.  As a result of this fix, it is 
            now possible to run programs residing in SRAM using the
            <code class="literal">continue</code> command from GDB.
          </li><li>
            The stub no longer prints status messages via GDB console
