-   Built-in global functions

    empty()
    die()
    mysqli_errno() -> Returns the error code for the most recent function call. It returns an int.
    mysqli_error() -> Returns a string description of the last error. It returns a string.
    mysqli_fetch_array -> Fetch a result row as an associative, a numeric array, or both
    crypt â€” One-way string hashing. The whole format of this function is: string crypt ( string $str [, string $salt ] ).
            crypt() will return a hashed string using the standard Unix DES-based algorithm or alternative algorithms 
            that may be available on the system. The salt parameter is optional. However, crypt() creates weak password 
            without salt. PHP 5.6 or later raise E_NOTICE error without it. Make sure specify strong enough salt for better security.
    get_magic_quotes_gpc()
    stripslashes() -> Un-quotes quoted string. The function stripslashes is used to remove backslashes from data. One use for this 
                      function, is to display data to which addslashes has been applied. What this means is that stripslashes would change I\'m hungry into I'm hungry.
    mysqli_real_escape_string() ->  Escapes special characters in a string for use in an SQL statement, taking into account the current charset of the connection. The
                                    Procedural style of this function is: string mysqli_real_escape_string ( mysqli $link , string $escapestr )

                                    Parameters: 1) link: Procedural style only: A link identifier returned by mysqli_connect() or mysqli_init()
                                                2) escapestr: The string to be escaped. Characters encoded are NUL (ASCII 0), \n, \r, \, ', ", and Control-Z.
    urldecode -> 
    header();    
  
    
-   Errors Handling in PHP
    
    PHP is configured through a php.ini configuration file that includes two important
    directives that affect error reporting: error_reporting and display_errors. The former
    controls what types of errors are trapped, and the latter controls whether error messages
    are reported.

-   Handling errors using the MySQLi library

    PHP provides error-reporting functions that provide the text error message and the
    numeric error code for a MySQL error that has occurred. Error numbers make it easier
    to look up information in the MySQL manual list of error codes and messages at http:
    //dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Error-handling.html

Questions

1)  A very strange statement:

    echo " | <a href='edit.php'>Edit gifts</a>";

    What is that '|' mean here?
