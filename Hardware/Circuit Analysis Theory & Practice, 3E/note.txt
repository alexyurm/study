1. Understand the meanings of chinese names of the following idioms:

- Proton
- Electron
- Neutron
- Atom = Protons + Neutrons + Electrons
- Nucleus = Protons + Neutrons
- Valence shell
- K, L, M, N, Valence(outmost) Shells

2. Atom can be positive charged or negatively charged. The term "charge" in this sense denotes an imbalance between the number of electrons and protons present in this atom.

3. Coulombâ€™s Law

   F = k(Q1Q2 )/r.^2 where k = 9x10.^9

4. The number of energy required to escape depends on the number of electrons   in the valence shell.
