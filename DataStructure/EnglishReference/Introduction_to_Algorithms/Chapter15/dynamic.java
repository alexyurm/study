/* Unlike Divide-and-Conquer, Dynamic Programming(DP) applies when the subproblems overlap - that is subproblems share subproblems.
*  In this context, DP solves each subproblems just once and saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work for recomputing the answer
*  every time it solves each subproblem. DP is especially useful for optimization problems, which is to find the best solution among many possible
*  solutions. 
*  
*  -  When developing a dynamic-programming algorithm, we follow a sqeuence of four steps:
*
*     1) Characterize the stucture of an optimal solution.
*     2) Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
*     3) Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
*     4) Construct an optimal solution from computed information.
