Algorithms and Data Structure

1. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor(LCA) in a binary tree.

2. Given a sorted linkedlist, create a binary tree with the array with minimum height. Noted that the question specified only binary tree and not binary search tree.

3. Given a set of number ranges, i.e. [1,5], [3,6], [7,9], write a program to merge overlapping number ranges. In above example, the result should be [1,6], [7,9].

-  Heap: priority heap
-  Sort: Heapify

4. Explain how hashmap works in java

5. designing and code - find characters that intersect in two string arrays - think memory and speed.

6. Write a function that divides one number by another, without using the division operator, and make it better than O(n).

7. Print Sprial matrix. For example:

   (0,0)    (0,1)    (0,2)
   (0,-1)   (1,-1)   (2,-1)
   (0,-2)   (1,-2)   (2,-2)

   print out: (0,0) (0,-1) (0,-2) (1,-2) (2,-2) (2,-1) (0,2) (0,1) (1,-1)

8. Given am InOrder traversal and PreOrder traversal of a binary tree, rebuild the tree.

9. You are given a matrix in any favorable data structure format. We want you to write a program to print the matrix in counter-clockwise order. See below as example: 

   INPUT:

   // 123

   // 123

   // 123

   // ------

   OUTPUT:

   // 1,1,1,2,3,3,3,2,2

   //

   (0,0)-->(1,0)->(2,0)

   (2,1)->(2,2)->(1,2)-->(0,2)-

   (0,1)->(1,1)

10.  You are given a binary search tree, how you serialize and deserialize it? what kind of traversal works

     Note: first of all, we need to understand what is serialization and deserialization in BST

     Serialization: it is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory
                    or transmitted across a network connection link to be "resurrected" later in the same or another computer environment.

                    Three ordering serialization: 1) preorder; 2) inorder; 3) postorder.

     Deserialization: The process of converting a sequence of bits back into a tree data structure

11. You are given an array of integers where most of them have been repeated even number of times except one which has been repeated odd number of times. 
    How can we find the number which appears odd number of times?

12. Amazon has logging problem. Each log file has history of all system access records and each access record has size from 1 to 255 bytes. Assuming we have 10 millions 
    records but there are repetitions (3millions distinct records). You need to find out the 10 most popular records for all queries and system has just 1GB memory. 

13. Two strings are called anagram if one of them is a rearrangement of the other one like "dog" and "god". Write an algorithm that takes two string and determined if they 
    are anagram or not.
    

Note:

1. If you cannot think of an optimized solution, think of a "slow" solution first and think about how to optimize that solution.



Mathematics:

1.  Out of a thousand identical buckets filled with water, exactly one contains a poison. Th poison will kill a pig in exactly 30 minutes. If you must
    locate the poisoned bucket within one hour, what is the minimum number of pigs needed?
