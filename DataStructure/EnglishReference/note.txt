Preface

-  Designing correct, efficient, and implementable algorithms for real-world problems requires access to two distinct bodies of knowledge:

   1) Techniques: Data Structures, dynamic programming, depth-first search, backtracking, heuristics and most importantly, modeling.

   2) Resources: The top designers are familiar with many classic algorithmic problems, which provide sufficient source material to model most any application.

 1 Introduction to Algorithm Design

-  An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task;

-  Three properties for a good algorithm:
   1) correct;
   2) efficient;
   3) easy to implement;
