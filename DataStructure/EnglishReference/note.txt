Chapter 1: The Role of Algorithms in Computing

-  What is algorithm?

   Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
   some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
   output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the
   input into the output.

-  What is data structure?

   A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access
   and modifications.
