include_directories()

-   add_library: Add a library to the project using the specified source files.

    Adds a library target called <name> to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation

-   add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir] 
                   [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])

    Add a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir specifies the directory in which the source CmakeList.txt and code files are located.

-   include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 dir2 ...)

    Add the given directories to those searched by the compiler for include files

-   link_directories(directory1 directory2 ...)

    Specify the paths in which the linker should search for libraries.

-   include(<file|module> [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE <VAR>]
                        [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

    Reads CMake listfile code from the given file. Commands in the file are processed immediately as if they were written in place of the include
    command.

-   find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
               [[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]]
               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

    Finds and loads settings from an external project

    -   every module (it is predefined in Find<name>.cmake) has the following variables:
        
        1.  <name>_FOUND
        2.  <name>_INCLUDE_DIR or <name>_INCLUDES
        3.  <name>_LIBRARY or <name>_LIBRARIES

        if <name>_FOUND is true, <name>_INCLUDE_DIR is added into INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, and <name>_LIBRARY is added into TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES.

    -   The system by default is looking for the file Find<name>.cmake. if the that is not found, the system will search for other files:1) <name>Config.cmake
        or 2) <name>-config.cmake. E.g.

        Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find Finddnab.cmake or set dnab_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for dnab.  The file will
        have one of the following names:

        dnabConfig.cmake
        dnab-config.cmake

-   target_link_libraries: link a target to given libraries.

    Specify a list of libraries to be linked into the specified target. If any library name matches that of a target in the current project a 
    dependency will automatically be added in the build system to make sure the library being linked is up-to-date before the target links.

-   find_path: Find the directory containing a file

    find_path(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

-   set_target_properties: set_target_properties: Targets can have properties that affect how they are built.

    set_target_properties(target1 target2 ...
                        PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                        prop2 value2 ...)
