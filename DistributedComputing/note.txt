Chapter 1 Introduction

-  Definition of a Distributed System

   A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that
   appears to its users as a single coherent system.

-  Goals

   -  Making Resources Accessible

      Resources include printers, computers, storage facilities, data,
      files, Web pages, and networks...

   -  Distribution Transparency

      Access
      Location
      Migration
      Relocation
      Replication
      Concurrency - Different uses may access the resource at the same time
      Failure

   -  Openness

      An open distributed system is a system that offers services according
      to standard rules that describe the syntax and semantics of those se-
      rvices. In distributed systems, services are generally specified
      through interfaces, which are often described in an Interface Definition
      Language(IDL). An interface definition allows an arbitrary process
      that needs a certain interface to talk to another process that provides
      that interface. Another goal for open distributed system is that it
      should be easy to configure the system out of different components.
      Also, it should be easy to add new components or replace existing
      ones without affecting those components that stay in place.

-  Types of Distributed Systems

   -  Distributed Computing Systems

      Cluster Computing: the underlying hardware consists of a collection of similar workstations or PCs, closely connected by means of a high
      speed local-area network. In addition, each node runs the same OS.

      Grid Computing: this type is often constructed as a federation of computer systems, where each system may fail under a different administrative
      domain, and may be very different when it comes to hardware, software, and deployed network technology.
