           <strong>[Section 6.4.4 of the First Edition]</strong>
<p>
H.323 is a standard for real-time audio and video conferencing among end
 systems on the Internet. As shown in Figure 6.13, the standard also 
covers how end systems attached to the Internet communicate with 
telephones attached to ordinary circuit-switched telephone networks. In 
principle, if manufacturers of Internet telephony and video conferencing
 all conform to H.323, then all their products should be able to 
interoperate, and should be able to communicate with ordinary 
telephones. We discuss H.323 in this section, as it provides an 
application context for RTP. Indeed, we'll see below that RTP is an 
integral part of the H.323 standard.

 to the Internet can communicate with telephones attached to a 
circuit-switched telephone network</font>
</center>
<p> </p><p>

H.323 <b>end points</b> (terminals) can be standalone devices (for 
example, Web phones and Web TVs) or applications in a PC (for example, 
Internet phone or video conferencing software). H.323 equipment also 
includes <b>gateways</b> and <b>gatekeepers.</b> Gateways permit 
communication among H.323 end points and ordinary telephones in a 
circuit-switched telephone network. Gatekeepers, which are optional, 
provide address translation, authorization, bandwidth management, 
accounting, and billing. We will discuss gatekeepers in more detail at 
the end of this section.

</p><p>

The H.323 standard is an umbrella specification that includes:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> A specification for how endpoints negotiate common audio/video 
encodings.  Because H.323 supports a variety of audio and video encoding
 standards, a  protocol is needed to allow the communicating endpoints 
to agree on a common encoding.

<p>

</p></li><li> A specification for how audio and video chunks are 
encapsulated and sent over network. As you may have guessed, this is 
where RTP comes into the picture.

<p>

</p></li><li> A specification for how endpoints communicate with their 
respective gatekeepers.

<p>

</p></li><li> A specification for how Internet phones communicate 
through a gateway with  ordinary phones in the public circuit-switched 
telephone network.
</li></ul>
<p>

Figure 6.14 shows the H.323 protocol architecture.

architecture</font>
</center>
<p> </p><p>

Minimally, each H.323 endpoint <i>must</i> support the G.711 speech 
compression standard. G.711 uses PCM to generate digitized speech at 
either 56 Kbps or 64 Kbps. Although H.323 requires every endpoint to be 
voice capable (through G.711), video capabilities are optional. Because 
video support is optional, manufacturers of terminals can sell simpler 
speech terminals as well as more complex terminals that support both 
audio and video.

</p><p>

As shown in Figure 6.14, H.323 also requires that all H.323 end points 
use the following protocols:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> <i>RTP.</i> The sending side of an endpoint encapsulates all media 
chunks within RTP packets. The sending side then passes the RTP packets 
to UDP.

<p>

</p></li><li> <i>H.245.</i> An "out-of-band" control protocol for 
controlling media between H.323 endpoints. This protocol is used to 
negotiate a common audio or video compression standard that will be 
employed by all the participating endpoints in a  session.

<p>

</p></li><li> <i>Q.931.</i> A signaling protocol for establishing and 
terminating calls. This protocol provides traditional telephone 
functionality (for example, dial tones and ringing) to H.323 endpoints 
and equipment.

<p>

</p></li><li> <i>RAS (Registration/Admission/Status) channel protocol.</i>
 A protocol that allows end points to communicate with a gatekeeper (if a
 gatekeeper is present).
</li></ul>
<p>

<strong>Audio and Video Compression</strong>

</p><p>

The H.323 standard supports a specific set of audio and video 
compression techniques. Let's first consider audio. As we just 
mentioned, all H.323 end points must support the G.711 speech encoding 
standard. Because of this requirement, two H.323 end points will always 
be able to default to G.711 and communicate. But H.323 allows terminals 
to support a variety of other speech compression standards, including 
G.723.1, G.722, G.728, and G.729. Many of these standards compress 
speech to rates that are suitable for 28.8 Kbps dial-up modems. For 
example, G.723.1 compresses speech to either 5.3 Kbps or 6.3 Kbps, with 
sound quality that is comparable to G.711.

</p><p>

As we mentioned earlier, video capabilities for an H.323 endpoint are 
optional. However, if an endpoint does support video, then it must (at 
the very least) support the QCIF H.261 (176 x144 pixels) video standard.
 A video-capable endpoint may optionally support other H.261 schemes, 
including CIF, 4CIF, 16CIF, and the H.263 standard. As the H.323 
standard evolves, it will likely support a longer list of audio and 
video compression schemes.

</p><p>

<strong>H.323 Channels</strong>

</p><p>

When an end point participates in an H.323 session, it maintains several
 channels, as shown in Figure 6.15. Examining Figure 6.15, we see that 
an end point can support many simultaneous RTP media channels. For each 
media type, there will typically be one send media channel and one 
receive media channel; thus, if audio and video are sent in separate RTP
 streams, there will typically be four media channels. Accompanying the 
RTP media channels, there is one RTCP media control channel, as 
discussed in Section 6.4.3. All of the RTP and RTCP channels run over 
UDP. In addition to the RTP/RTCP channels, two other channels are 
required: the call control channel and the call signaling channel. The 
H.245 call control channel is a TCP connection that carries H.245 
control messages. Its principal tasks are (1) opening and closing media 
channels, and (2) capability exchange, that is, before sending media, 
endpoints agree on an encoding algorithm. H.245, being a control 
protocol for real-time interactive applications, is analogous to RTSP, 
the control protocol for streaming of stored multimedia that we studied 
in Section 6.2.3. Finally, the Q.931 call signaling channel provides 
classical telephone functionality, such as dial tone and ringing.

</center>
<p> </p><p>

<strong>Gatekeepers</strong>

</p><p>

The gatekeeper is an optional H.323 device. Each gatekeeper is 
responsible for an H.323 zone. A typical deployment scenario is shown in
 Figure 6.16. In this scenario, the H.323 terminals and the gatekeeper 
are all attached to the same LAN, and the H.323 zone is the LAN itself. 
If a zone has a gatekeeper, then all H.323 terminals in the zone are 
required to communicate with it using the RAS protocol, which runs over 
TCP. Address translation is one of the more important gatekeeper 
services. Each terminal can have an alias address, such as the name of 
the person at the terminal, the e-mail address of the person at the 
terminal, and so on. The gateway translates these alias addresses to IP 
addresses. This address translation service is similar to the DNS 
service, covered in Section 2.5. Another gatekeeper service is bandwidth
 management: The gatekeeper can limit the number of simultaneous 
real-time conferences in order to save some bandwidth for other 
applications running over the LAN. Optionally, H.323 calls can be routed
 through gatekeeper, which is useful for billing.

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="H323_files/06-16.jpg" alt="Figure 6.16" height="249" 
width="350"><br>
<font size="-1"><strong>Figure 6.16:</strong> H.323 terminals and 
gatekeeper on the same LAN</font>
</center>
<p> </p><p>

The H.323 terminal must register itself with the gatekeeper in its zone.
 When the H.323 application is invoked at the terminal, the terminal 
uses RAS to send its IP address and alias (provided by user) to the 
gatekeeper. If the gatekeeper is present in a zone, each terminal in the
 zone must contact the gatekeeper to ask permission to make a call. Once
 it has permission, the terminal can send the gatekeeper an e-mail 
address, alias string, or phone extension for the terminal it wants to 
call, which may be in another zone. If necessary, a gatekeeper will poll
 other gatekeepers in other zones to resolve an IP address.

An excellent tutorial on H.323 is provided by [WebProForum 1999]. The 
reader is also encouraged to see [Rosenberg 1999] for an alternative 
architecture to H.323 for providing telephone service in the Internet.
