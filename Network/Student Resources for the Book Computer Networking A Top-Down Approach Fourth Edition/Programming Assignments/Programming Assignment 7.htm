<h1>Programming Assignment 7: Streaming Video with RTSP and RTP</h1>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>In this lab you will implement a streaming video server and client 
that 
communicate using the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and send data 
using 
the Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP). Your task is to implement the 
RTSP 
protocol in the client and implement the RTP packetization in the 
server. 
</p><p>We will provide you code that implements the RTSP protocol in the
 server, the 
RTP de-packetization in the client, and takes care of displaying the 
transmitted 
video. You do not need to touch this code. 
</p><h3>Classes</h3>
<p>There are 4 classes in the assignment. 
</p><dl>
  <dt>
  <a target="_blank" 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/Client.html"><b>Client</b>
  </a> 
  </dt><dd>This class implements the client and the user interface which
 you use to 
  send RTSP commands and which is used to display the video. Below is 
what the 
  interface looks like. <em>You will need to implement the actions that 
are 
  taken when the buttons are pressed</em>. 
  </dd><dt><b><a 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/Server.html"
 target="_blank">Server</a></b> 
  </dt><dd>This class implements the server which responds to the RTSP 
requests and 
  streams back the video. The RTSP interaction is already implemented 
and the 
  server calls routines in the RTPpacket class to packetize the video 
data. You 
  do not need to modify this class. 
  </dd><dt><b><a 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/RTPpacket.html"
 target="_blank">RTPpacket</a></b> 
  </dt><dd>This class is used to handle the RTP packets. It has separate
 routines for 
  handling the received packets at the client side which is given and 
you do not 
  need to modify it (but see <a 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/lab7.html#optional">Optional
 
  Exercises</a>). <em>You will need to complete the first constructor of
 this 
  class to implement RTP-packetization of the video data</em>. The 
second 
  constructor is used by the client to de-packetize the data. You do not
 need to 
  modify that. 
  </dd><dt><b><a 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/VideoStream.html"
 target="_blank">VideoStream</a></b> 
  </dt><dd>This class is used to read video data from the file on disk. 
You do not 
  need to modify this class. </dd></dl>
<h3>Running the Code</h3>
<p><b>After completing the code, you can run it as follows</b>. 
</p><p>First, start the server with the command </p><pre>        java Server server_port
</pre>
<p>where <tt>server_port</tt> is the port your server listens to for 
incoming 
RTSP connections. The standard RTSP port is 554, but you will need to 
choose a 
port number greater than 1024. 
</p><p>Then, start the client with the command </p><pre>        java Client server_name server_port video_file
</pre>
<p>where <tt>server_host</tt> is the name of the machine where the 
server is 
running, <tt>server_port</tt> is the port the server is listening on, 
and 
<tt>video_file</tt> is the name of the file you want to request (we have
 
provided one example file <tt><a 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/movie.Mjpeg">movie.Mjpeg</a></tt>).
 
The file format is described in the <a 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/lab7.html#appendix">Appendix</a>.
 

</p><p>The client opens a connection to the server and pops up a window 
like this: 
</p><p align="center"><img 
src="Programming%20Assignment%207_files/screenshot.jpg" height="370" 
width="390"> 
</p><p>You can send RTSP commands to the server by pressing the buttons.
 A normal 
RTSP interaction goes as follows. 
</p><ol>
  <li>Client sends SETUP. This command is used to set up the session and
 
  transport parameters. 
  </li><li>Client sends PLAY. This starts the playback. 
  </li><li>Client may send PAUSE if it wants to pause during playback. 
  </li><li>Client sends TEARDOWN. This terminates the session and closes
 the 
  connection. </li></ol>
<p>The server alway replies to all the messages the client sends. The 
reply 
codes are roughly the same as in HTTP. The code 200 means that the 
request was 
successful. In this lab you do not need to implement any other reply 
codes. For 
more information about RTSP, please see RFC 2326. 
</p><hr>

<h2>1. Client</h2>
<p>Your first task is to implement the RTSP on the client side. To do 
this, you 
need to complete the functions that are called when the user clicks on 
the 
buttons in the user interface. For each button in the interface there is
 a 
handler function in the code. You will need to implement the following 
actions 
in each handler function. 
</p><p>When the client starts, it also opens the RTSP socket to the 
server. Use this 
socket for sending all RTSP requests. 
</p><h3>SETUP</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a socket for receiving RTP data and set the timeout on the 
socket 
  to 5 milliseconds. 
  </li><li>Send SETUP request to server. You will need to insert the 
Transport header 
  in which you specify the port for the RTP data socket you just 
created. 
  </li><li>Read reply from server and parse the Session header in the 
response to get 
  the session ID. </li></ul>
<h3>PLAY</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Send PLAY request. You must insert the Session header and use the 
session 
  ID returned in the SETUP response. You must not put the Transport 
header in 
  this request. 
  </li><li>Read server's response. </li></ul>
<h3>PAUSE</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Send PAUSE request. You must insert the Session header and use the
 session 
  ID returned in the SETUP response. You must not put the Transport 
header in 
  this request. 
  </li><li>Read server's response. </li></ul>
<h3>TEARDOWN</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Send TEARDOWN request. You must insert the Session header and use 
the 
  session ID returned in the SETUP response. You must not put the 
Transport 
  header in this request. 
  </li><li>Read server's response. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>You must insert the CSeq header in every 
request 
you send</em>. The value of the CSeq header is a number which is 
incremented by 
one for each request you send. 
</p><h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here is a sample interaction between the client and server. The 
client's 
requestes are marked with C: and server's replies with S:. In this lab 
both the 
client and the server are <strong>very simple</strong>. They do not have
 
sophisticated parsing routines and they <em>expect the header fields to 
be in 
the order you see below</em>. That is, in a request, the first header is
 CSeq, 
and the second one is either Transport (for SETUP) or Session (for all 
other 
requests). In the reply, CSeq is again the first and Session is the 
second. </p><pre>C: SETUP movie.Mjpeg RTSP/1.0
C: CSeq: 1
C: Transport: RTP/UDP; client_port= 25000

S: RTSP/1.0 200 OK
S: CSeq: 1
S: Session: 123456

C: PLAY movie.Mjpeg RTSP/1.0
C: CSeq: 2
C: Session: 123456

S: RTSP/1.0 200 OK
S: CSeq: 2
S: Session: 123456

C: PAUSE movie.Mjpeg RTSP/1.0
C: CSeq: 3
C: Session: 123456

S: RTSP/1.0 200 OK
S: CSeq: 3
S: Session: 123456

C: PLAY movie.Mjpeg RTSP/1.0
C: CSeq: 4
C: Session: 123456

S: RTSP/1.0 200 OK
S: CSeq: 4
S: Session: 123456

C: TEARDOWN movie.Mjpeg RTSP/1.0
C: CSeq: 5
C: Session: 123456

S: RTSP/1.0 200 OK
S: CSeq: 5
S: Session: 123456
</pre>
<h3>Client State</h3>
<p>One of the key differences between HTTP and RTSP is that in RTSP each
 session 
has a state. In this lab you will need to keep the client's state 
up-to-date. 
Client changes state when it receives a reply from the server according 
to the 
following state diagram. 
</p><p align="center"><img 
src="Programming%20Assignment%207_files/state.gif" height="237" 
width="660"> 
</p><hr>

<h2>2. Server</h2>
<p>On the server you will need to implement the packetization of the 
video data 
into RTP packets. For this you will need to create the packet, set the 
fields in 
the packet header, and copy the payload (i.e., one video frame) into the
 packet. 

</p><p>When the server receives the PLAY-request from the client, it 
starts a timer 
which is triggered every 100 ms. At these times the server will read one
 video 
frame from the file and send it to the client. The server creates an 
RTPpacket-object which is the RTP-encapsulation of the video frame. 
</p><p>The server calls the first constructor of the class RTPpacket to 
perform the 
encapsulation. Your task is to write this function. You will need to do 
the 
following: (the letters in parenthesis refer to the fields in the RTP 
packet 
format below) 
</p><ol>
  <li>Set the RTP-version field (V). You must set this to 2. 
  </li><li>Set padding (P), extension (X), number of contributing 
sources (CC), and 
  marker (M) fields. <em>These are all set to zero in this lab</em>. 
  </li><li>Set payload type field (PT). In this lab we use MJPEG and the
 type for 
  that is 26. 
  </li><li>Set the sequence number. The server gives this the sequence 
number as the 
  <tt>Framenb</tt> argument to the constructor. 
  </li><li>Set the timestamp. The server gives this number as the <tt>Time</tt>
 
  argument to the constructor. 
  </li><li>Set the source identifier (SSRC). This field identifies the 
server. You 
  can pick any integer value you like. </li></ol>
<p>Because we have no other contributing sources (field CC == 0), the 
CSRC-field 
does not exist. The length of the packet header is therefore 12 bytes, 
or the 
first three lines from the diagram below. </p><pre>    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

</pre>
<p>You must fill in the header in the array <tt>header</tt> of the 
RTPpacket-class. You will also need to copy the payload (given as 
argument 
<tt>data</tt>) to the variable <tt>payload</tt>. The length of the 
payload is 
given in the argument <tt>data_length</tt>. 
</p><p>The above diagram is in the network byte order (also known as 
big-endian). 
The Java Virtual Machine uses the same byte order so you do not need to 
transform your packet header into the network byte order. 
</p><p>For more details on RTP, please see RFC 1889. 
</p><h3>Twiddling the Bits</h3>
<p>Here are some examples on how to set and check individual bits or 
groups of 
bits. Note that in the RTP packet header format smaller bit-numbers 
refer to 
higher order bits, that is, bit number 0 of a byte is 2^7 and bit number
 7 is 1 
(or 2^0). In the examples below, the bit numbers refer to the numbers in
 the 
above diagram. 
</p><p>Because the header-field of the RTPpacket class is an array of 
type 
<tt>byte</tt>, you will need to set the header one byte at a time, that 
is in 
groups of 8 bits. The first byte has bits 0-7, the second byte has bits 
8-15, 
and so on. In Java an int is 32 bits or 4 bytes. 
</p><p>To set bit number <i>n</i> in variable <tt>mybyte</tt> of type 
byte: </p><pre>        mybyte = mybyte | 1 &lt;&lt; (7 - n);
</pre>
<p>To set bits <i>n</i> and <i>n + 1</i> to the value of <tt>foo</tt> in
 
variable <tt>mybyte</tt>: </p><pre>       mybyte = mybyte | foo &lt;&lt; (7 - n);
</pre>
<p>Note that <tt>foo</tt> must have a value that can be expressed with 2
 bits, 
that is, 0, 1, 2, or 3. 
</p><p>To copy a 16-bit integer <tt>foo</tt> into 2 bytes, <tt>b1</tt> 
and 
<tt>b2</tt>: </p><pre>       b1 = foo &gt;&gt; 8;
       b2 = foo &amp; 0xFF;
</pre>
<p>After this, <tt>b1</tt> will have the 8 high-order bits of <tt>foo</tt>
 and 
<tt>b2</tt> will have the 8 low-order bits of <tt>foo</tt>. 
</p><p>You can copy a 32-bit integer into 4 bytes in a similar way. 
</p><p>If you're not comfortable setting bits, you can find more 
information in <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/bitwise.html"
 target="_blank">the Java Tutorial</a>. 
</p><h3>Bit Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we want to fill in the first byte of the RTP packet header 
with the 
following values: 
</p><ul>
  <li>V = 2 
  </li><li>P = 0 
  </li><li>X = 0 
  </li><li>CC = 3 </li></ul>
<p>In binary this would be represented as </p><pre>        1 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 0 1 1
        V=2   P   X   CC = 3

       2^7 . . . . . . . . 2^0
</pre>

<h2><a name="optional">Optional Exercises</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Instead of the normal server given to you, use the class called <tt><a
 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/FunkyServer.class">FunkyServer</a></tt>
 
  (download also the class <a 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab7/FunkyServer$1.class">FunkyServer$1.class</a>),
 
  i.e., run it with <tt>java FunkyServer server_port</tt>. What do you 
see at 
  the client? Explain what happens, why, and fix it. 
  </li><li>Calculate statistics about the session. You will need to 
calculate RTP 
  packet loss rate, video data rate (in bits or bytes per second), and 
any other 
  interesting statistics you can think of. 
  </li><li>The user interface on the client has 4 buttons for the 4 
actions. If you 
  compare this to a standard media player, such as RealPlayer or Windows
 Media 
  Player, you can see that they have only 3 buttons for the same 
actions, 
  namely, PLAY, PAUSE, and STOP (roughly corresponding to TEARDOWN). 
There is no 
  SETUP-button available to the user. Given that SETUP is mandatory in 
an 
  RTSP-interaction, how would you implement that in a media player? When
 does 
  the client send the SETUP? Come up with a solution and implement it. 
Is it 
  appropriate to send TEARDOWN when user clicks on the stop-button? 
  </li><li>Currently the client and server only implement the minimum 
necessary RTSP 
  interactions and PAUSE. Implement the method DESCRIBE which is used to
 pass 
  information about the media stream. When the server receives a 
  DESCRIBE-request, it sends back a session description file which tells
 the 
  client what kinds of streams are in the session and what encodings are
 used. 
  </li></ul>
<h2><a name="appendix">Appendix</a></h2>
<p>Lab's proprietary MJPEG (Motion JPEG) format. 
</p><p>In this lab, the server streams a video which has been encoded 
into a 
proprietary MJPEG file format. This format stores the video as 
concatenated 
JPEG-encoded images, with each image being preceded by a 5-Byte header 
which 
indicates the bit size of the image. The server parses the bitstream of 
the 
MJPEG file to extract the JPEG images on the fly. The server sends the 
images to 
the client at periodic intervals. The client then displays the 
individual JPEG 
images as they arrive from the server. </p></body></html>
