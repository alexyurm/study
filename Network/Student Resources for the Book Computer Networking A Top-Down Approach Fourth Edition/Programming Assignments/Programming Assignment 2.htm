<h1>Programming Assignment 2:  A Mail User Agent in Java</h1>

<p>In this lab you will implement a mail user agent that sends mail to
other users. Your task is to program the SMTP interaction between the
MUA and the local SMTP server. The client provides a graphical user
interface containing fields for entering the sender and recipient
addresses, the subject of the message and the message itself.  Here's
what the user interface looks like:<br><br>

</p><center>
<img src="Programming%20Assignment%202_files/interface.gif" 
alt="[Interface]" height="342" width="420">
</center>

<p>With this interface, when you want to send a mail, you must fill in
complete addresses for both the sender and the recipient, i.e.,
<code>user@someschool.edu</code>, not just simply
<code>user</code>. You can send mail to only one recipient. You will
also need to give the name (or IP address) of your local
mailserver. If you do not know the name of your local mailserver, see
<a href="#dns">Querying the DNS</a> below for more information on how
to obtain the address of the local mailserver.

</p><p>When you have finished composing your mail, press <i>Send</i> to
send it.



</p><h2>The Code</h2>


<p>The program consists of four classes:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><td width="150">MailClient</td> <td width="300">The user 
interface</td> </tr>
  
<tr><td width="150">Message</td> <td width="300"> Mail message</td></tr>

  <tr><td width="150">Envelope</td> <td width="300"> SMTP envelope 
around the Message</td></tr>
  <tr><td width="150">SMTPConnection</td> <td width="300"> Connection to
 the SMTP server</td></tr>

</tbody></table>


</p><p>You will need to complete the code in the
<code>SMTPConnection</code> class so that in the end you will have a
program that is capable of sending mail to any recipient. The code for
the <code>SMTPConnection</code> class is at the <a 
href="#smtpconnection">end of this page</a>. The code for the other
three classes is provided <a 
href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab2/othercode.html">on
 this page</a>.

</p><p>The places where you need to complete the code have been marked
with the comments <code>/* Fill in */</code>. Each of the places
requires one or more lines of code.

</p><p>The <code>MailClient</code> class provides the user interface and
calls the other classes as needed. When you press <i>Send</i>, the
<code>MailClient</code> class constructs a <code>Message</code> class
object to hold the mail message. The <code>Message</code> object holds 
the actual message headers and body. Then the <code>MailClient</code>
object builds the SMTP envelope using the <code>Envelope</code>
class. This class holds the SMTP sender and recipient information, the 
SMTP server of the recipient's domain, and the <code>Message</code>
object. Then the <code>MailClient</code> object creates the
<code>SMTPConnection</code> object which opens a connection to the
SMTP server and the <code>MailClient</code> object sends the message
over the connection. The sending of the mail happens in three phases:
</p><ol>
  <li> The <code>MailClient</code> object creates the
      <code>SMTPConnection</code> object and opens the connection to
      the SMTP server.
  </li><li> The <code>MailClient</code> object sends the message using 
the
      function <code>SMTPConnection.send()</code>.
  </li><li> The <code>MailClient</code> object closes the SMTP 
connection.
</li></ol>

<p>The <code>Message</code> class contains the function
<code>isValid()</code> which is used to check the addresses of the
sender and recipient to make sure that there is only one address and
that the address contains the @-sign. The provided code does not do
any other error checking.

</p><hr>

<h2>Reply Codes</h2>

<p>For the basic interaction of sending one message, you will only
need to implement a part of SMTP. In this lab you need only
to implement the following SMTP commands:<br> <br>

<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Command </th><th>Reply Code</th></tr>
  <tr><td>DATA </td><td>354</td></tr>
  <tr><td>HELO </td><td>250</td></tr>
  <tr><td>MAIL FROM </td><td>250</td></tr>
  <tr><td>QUIT </td><td>221</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RCPT TO </td><td>250</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>The above table also lists the accepted reply codes for each of 
the
SMTP commands you need to implement. For simplicity, you can assume
that any other reply from the server indicates a fatal error and abort
the sending of the message. In reality, SMTP distinguishes between
transient (reply codes 4xx) and permanent (reply codes 5xx) errors,
and the sender is allowed to repeat commands that yielded in a
transient error. See Appendix E of <a 
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0821.txt?number=821">RFC 821</a> for
more details.

</p><p>In addition, when you open a connection to the server, it will
reply with the code 220.

</p><p><em>Note:</em> RFC 821 allows the code 251 as a response to a 
RCPT
TO-command to indicate that the recipient is not a local user. You may 
want to verify manually with the <code>telnet</code> command what your 
local SMTP server replies.

</p><hr>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>Most of the code you will need to fill in is similar to the code
you wrote in the WebServer lab.  You may want to use the code you have
written there to help you.

</p><p>To make it easier to debug your program, do not, at first, 
include
the code that opens the socket, but use the following definitions for
<code>fromServer</code> and <code>toServer</code>. This way, your
program sends the commands to the terminal. Acting as the SMTP server,
you will need to give the correct reply codes. When your program
works, add the code to open the socket to the server.

</p><pre>       fromServer = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
       toServer = System.out;
</pre>

<p>The lines for opening and closing the socket, i.e., the lines
<code>connection = ...</code> in the constructor and the line
<code>connection.close()</code> in function <code>close()</code>, have
been commented out by default.

</p><p>Start by completing the function <code>parseReply()</code>. You
will need this function in many places. In the function
<code>parseReply()</code>, you should use the
<code>StringTokenizer</code>-class for parsing the reply strings. You
can convert a string to an integer as follows:

</p><pre>	   int i = Integer.parseInt(argv[0]);
</pre>

<p>In the function <code>sendCommand()</code>, you should use the
function <code>writeBytes()</code> to write the commands to the
server. The advantage of using <code>writeBytes()</code> instead of
<code>write()</code> is that the former automatically converts the
strings to bytes which is what the server expects. Do not forget to
terminate each command with the string CRLF.

</p><p>You can throw exceptions like this:

</p><pre>           throw new Exception();
</pre>

<p>You do not need to worry about details, since the exceptions in
this lab are only used to signal an error, not to give detailed
information about what went wrong.

</p><hr>

<h2>Optional Exercises</h2>

<p>You may want to try the following optional exercises to make your
program more sophisticated. For these exercises, you will need to
modify also the other classes (MailClient, Message, and Envelope).

</p><ul>
  <li> <b>Verify sender address</b>. Java's System-class contains
      information about the username and the InetAddress-class
      contains methods for finding the name of the local host. Use
      these to construct the sender address for the Envelope instead
      of using the user-supplied value in the From-header.
  </li><li> <b>Additional headers</b>. The generated mails have only 
four
      header fields, From, To, Subject, and Date. Add other header
      fields from RFC 822, e.g., Message-ID, Keywords. Check the <a 
href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC</a>
      for the definitions of the different fields.
  </li><li> <b>Multiple recipients</b>. Currently the program only 
allows
      sending mail to a single recipient. Modify the user interface to 
      include a Cc-field and modify the program to send mail to both
      recipients. For a more challenging exercise, modify the program
      to send mail to an arbitrary number of recipients.
  </li><li> <b>More error checking</b>. The provided code assumes that 
all
      errors that occur during the SMTP connection are fatal. Add code 
      to distinguish between fatal and non-fatal errors and add a
      mechanism for signaling them to the user. Check the RFC to see
      what the different reply codes mean. This exercise may require
      large modifications to the <code>send()</code>,
      <code>sendCommand()</code>, and <code>parseReply()</code>
      functions.
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="dns">Querying the DNS</a></h2>

<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) stores information in resource
records. Normal name to IP-address mappings are stored in type A
(Address) resource records. Type NS (NameServer) records hold
information about nameservers and type MX (Mail eXchange) records tell
which server is handling the mail delivery of the domain.

</p><p>The server you need to find is the server handling the mail for
      your school's domain. First, you must find the nameserver of
      your school and then query this nameserver for the
      MX-host. Assuming you are at Someschool and your domain is
      <code>someschool.edu</code>, you would do the following:
</p><ol>
  <li> Find the address of a nameserver for the top-level
      domain <code>.edu</code> (NS query)
  </li><li> Query the nameserver for .edu about the nameserver for the
      domain <code>someschool.edu</code> to get the address of
      Someschool's nameserver. (NS query)
  </li><li> Query Someschool's nameserver for MX-records for the domain
      <code>someschool.edu</code>. (MX query)
</li></ol>

<p>Ask your local system administrator how to perform DNS queries
manually. 

</p><p>Under Unix you can query DNS manually with the
<code>nslookup</code>-command. The syntax of the
<code>nslookup</code>-command is as follows. Note that the argument
<code>host</code> can also be a domain.

<table>
  <tbody><tr><td>Normal query </td><td><code>nslookup host</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Normal query using a given server </td><td><code>nslookup host
 server</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>NS-query </td><td><code>nslookup -type=NS host</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>MX-query </td><td><code>nslookup -type=MX host</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>


</p><p>The reply to the MX-query may contain multiple mail
exchangers. Each of them is preceded by a number which is the
preference value for this server. Lower preference values indicate
preferred servers so you should use the server with the lowest
preference value.
