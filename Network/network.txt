Chapter 1: Protocol Layers and Their Service Models

-  Five-layer internet protocol stack

   1) Application

   It is the layer where the network applications and their application-layer protocols reside:

   HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
   SMTP (Symple Mail Transfer Protocol)
   FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
   DNS (Domain name system) -> translation of human-friendly names for Internet end systems like google.com to a 32-bit network address

   2) Transport

   The Internet's transport layer transports application-layer messages between application endpoints:
   
   TCP
   UDP

   3) Network

   The network layer provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer in the detination host. The Internet's network layer also contains routing protocols that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and destinations.

   IPv4: 32-bit address
   IPv6: 128-bit address

   4) Link

   5) Physical

-  Traceroute: provides delay measurement from source to route along end-end internet path towards destination.
