1. Introduction

-  The deluge of data calls for automated methods of data analysis, 
   which is what machine learning provides. We define machine learning
   as a set of methods that can automatically detect patterns in data, and
   then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data, or to perform
   other kinds of decision making under uncertainty(such as planning how
   to collect more data!).

-  It should be noted, however, that even when one has an apparently massive
   data set, the effective number of data points for certain cases of
   interest might be quite small. For example, 20% of Google searches
   each day have never been seen before. This means that the core
   statistical issues that we discuss in this book, concerning generalizing
   from relatively small samples sizes, are still very relevant even in
   the big data era.

-  Two main types of machine learning:

   1) predictive
   2) supervised learning
