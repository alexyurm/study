An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:
-   An HTML web page has finished loading
-   An HTML input field was changed
-   An HTML button was clicked

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. HTML allows 
event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

With single quotes:

<some-HTML-element some-event='some JavaScript'>

With double quotes:

<some-HTML-element some-event="some JavaScript">

Common HTML events:

onchange    -   An HTML element has been changed
onclick     -   The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover -   The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout  -   The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown   -   The user pushes a keyboard key
onload      -   The browser has finished loading the page
