   /*
   *  -  For the Observable to send notifications, 
   *
   *     You first must call the setChanged() method to signify that the state has changed in your object.
   *
   *     Then call either notifyObserbers() or notifyObservers(Object arg)
   *
   *  -  Why do we use setChanged() method?
   *
   *     Because:
   *
   *     setChanged() {
   *         changed = true;
   *     }
   *
   *  -  notifyObservers(Object arg) {
   *        if (changed) {
   *           for every observer on the list {
   *              call update(this, arg)
   *           }
   *           changed = false;
   *        }
   *     }
   *
   *  Why is the necessary? The setChanged() method is meant to give you more flexibility in how you update observers by allowing you to optimize 
   *  the notifications. E.g.
   *  If the temperature readings were constantly fluctuating, we might want to send out notifications only if the temperature changes more than 
   *  half of a degree and we could call setChanged() only after that. If the functionality is useful to you, you may also want to use 
   *  the clearChanged() method, which sets the changed state back to false, and the hasChanged() method, which tells you the current state of 
   *  the changed flag.
