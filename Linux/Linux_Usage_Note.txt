The Network File System is an open standard defined in RFCs, allowing anyone to implement the protocol.

   devices, including firmware load.

7. Set environment variable in Ubuntu:

   -  To set variable only for current shell:

   -  To set it permanently for all future bash sessions add such line to your .bashrc file in your $HOME directory.

      sudo vi ~/.bashrc

   -  To set it permanently, and system wide (all users, all processes) add set variable in /etc/environment:

      sudo vi /etc/environment
