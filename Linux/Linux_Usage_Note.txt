1.    chown command -> Change the owner of files or directories

2.    ps command -> Report the process status

3.    Network File System (NFS protocol) -> A network file system protocol allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC)system. The Network File System is an open standard defined in RFCs, allowing anyone to implement the protocol.

4.    tar command -> Tar stores and extracts files from a tape or disk archive.

5.    awk command

6.    udev -> udev is the device manager for Linux kernel. Primarily, it manages device nodes in /dev. It is the successor of devfs and hotplug, which means that it handles the /dev directory and all user space actions when adding/removing
   devices, including firmware load.

7. Set environment variable in Ubuntu:

      -  To set variable only for current shell:

         VARNAME="my value"
      
      -  To set it for current shell and all processes started from current shell:

         export VARNAME="my value"      # shorter, less portable version
         
      -  To set it permanently for all future bash sessions add such line to your .bashrc file in your $HOME directory.

         sudo vi ~/.bashrc

      -  To set it permanently, and system wide (all users, all processes) add set variable in /etc/environment:

         sudo vi /etc/environment

8.    Check the ubuntu upate history:

      less /var/log/apt/histor.log

9.    The following commands explain how to remove, install and reconfigure xorg, without reinstalling ubuntu. This is very useful if you messup with your xorg file.

      -  Remove existing xorg using the following command:

         sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg

      -  Install xorg using the following command:

         sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg

      -  Reconfigure xorg using the following command

         sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

10.   Adding Launched PPA Repositories

      PPA (Personal Package Archive) repositories. This command is the same as addrepo available on Debian.

      E.g.

      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fcitx-team/stable

11.   gnome-tweak-tool

      sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool

      This tool is for displaying trash can on the Mint13 desktop.

12.   How to resolve the X230 random freeze problem on 12.04.

      Upgrade the kernel from 3.2 to 3.4:

      1) Download the 3 deb packages files.

      linux-image-3.4.0-030400-generic-pae_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_i386.deb
      linux-headers-3.4.0-030400_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_all.deb
      linux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic-pae_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_i386.deb

      2) Go to the download directory and do:

      sudo dkpg -i *.deb

      3) Restart the computer

      sudo init 6

13.   Enabling PAE manually: sudo apt-get install linux-generics-pae linux-headers-generic-pae

      If PAE was successfully enabled you may want to remove the meta-package for the normal kernel. In order to disable unnecessary updates to the non-PAE kernels:

      sudo apt-get remove linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic

      If you want to remove all of the old kernels from your boot menu, it seems like you have to do it all manually:

      sudo apt-get remove linux-image-<version number>-generic linux-headers-<version number>-generic

      If Something went wrong, just remove the PAE kernel packages using either synaptic or apt-get/aptitude.Â If you did not specifically remove the non-PAE kernel 
      packages, they should still be present on the system and automatically selected as the default when the PAE kernel is removed.

      The relevant PAE kernel packages are:

      linux-image-generic-pae  linux-image-<version number>-generic-pae linux-headers-generic-pae linux-headers-<version number>-generic-pae

14.   to get the package installation info, you can use the aptitude tool:

      for example:

      aptitude search dejagnu

15.   Release Cache memory:

      su

      free && sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && free

16.   Using curl command to send HTTP requests

      For example:

      curl -i http://172.22.0.76/service/network_manager/status

      The above command sets HTTP GET to the specified URL

17.   (!!) There are 3 different bash configure files in Ubuntu:

      E.g. How to set JAVA_HOME environment variable in Ubuntu

      Setting the JAVA_HOME variable can be done in several ways:

      1. Globally and at System level, i.e. no user is required to be logged in. This is the prefered way if you are configuring a server and planning to use boot strapped 
      program that needs JAVA_HOME variable.

        /etc/environment
        JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle

      2. Globally and set for all logged in user, i.e. one user is needed to be logged in, to have the JAVA_HOME variable set.
        
        /etc/bash.bashrc

      3. User specific. Then the variable is only set when the designated user is logged in.

        /home/$USER/.bashrc

18.     All the host name maping is in this file:

        /etc/hosts

        E.g. The file content looks like the following:

         127.0.0.1 localhost
         127.0.1.1 alexyu.disternetdomain.com AlexYu
         # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
         ::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
         fe00::0 ip6-localnet
         ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
         ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
         ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

19.     The Virtualbox has some rendering problem on Chrome browser, to solve this: 

        Add the line: --blacklist-accelerated-compositing 

        at the end of each Exec apperance in the following file:

        /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop

20.     Change to another use through command line. E.g.

        sudo su - postgres

21.     File: /etc/passwd

        this file stores essential information, which is required during login. i.e. user account information
        To understand the fields in /etc/passwd, please look at:

        alexyu:x:1000:1000:alexyu,,,:/home/alexyu:/bin/bash
            |  |   |   |     |              |           | 
            |  |   |   |     |              |           |
            1  2   3   4     5              6           7

        1.  Username: it is used when user logs in, it should be 1 and 32 characters in length
        2.  Password: an x character indicates that encrypted password.
        3.  User ID(UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID(UID), UID 0(zero) is reserved for
            root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are
            reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
        4.  Group ID(GID): The primary group ID
        5.  User ID Info: The comment field. It allows you to add extra information about the users
            such as user's full name, phone number etc. This field is used by finger command(??).
        6.  Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they login. If
            this directory does not exist then the users directory becomes /
        7.  Command/shell: The absolute path command or shell (bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell.
            Please note that it does not have to be a shell.

        -   Common commands:

        1)  See User list

            $ cat /etc/passwd

        2)  To search for a username called tom, enter:

            $ grep tom /etc/passwd

22. Command to add a new user:

    sudo adduser jahan

23. Command to delete a user:

    sudo userdel jahan 

24. sudo command options

    -u

    the -u (user) option causes sudo to run the specified command as a user other than root. To specify 
    a uid instead of a username, use #uid.

25. How to do Remote edit with local editor (Linux)

    sshfs user@host:remote_dir /path/to/mount_point

    e.g.

    sshfs alexyu@96.49.157.118:/var/www/aioptify.com /home/alexyu/Desktop/aioptify.com/

26. To simulate how apt-get install is going to do. try this. e.g. php5

    apt-cache policy php5
