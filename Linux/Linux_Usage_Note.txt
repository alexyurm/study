1.    chown command -> Change the owner of files or directories

2.    ps command -> Report the process status

3.    Network File System (NFS protocol) -> A network file system protocol allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC)system. The Network File System is an open standard defined in RFCs, allowing anyone to implement the protocol.

4.    tar command -> Tar stores and extracts files from a tape or disk archive.

5.    awk command

6.    udev -> udev is the device manager for Linux kernel. Primarily, it manages device nodes in /dev. It is the successor of devfs and hotplug, which means that it handles the /dev directory and all user space actions when adding/removing
   devices, including firmware load.

7. Set environment variable in Ubuntu:

      -  To set variable only for current shell:

         VARNAME="my value"
      
      -  To set it for current shell and all processes started from current shell:

         export VARNAME="my value"      # shorter, less portable version
         
      -  To set it permanently for all future bash sessions add such line to your .bashrc file in your $HOME directory.

         sudo vi ~/.bashrc

      -  To set it permanently, and system wide (all users, all processes) add set variable in /etc/environment:

         sudo vi /etc/environment

8.    Check the ubuntu upate history:

      less /var/log/apt/histor.log

9.    The following commands explain how to remove, install and reconfigure xorg, without reinstalling ubuntu. This is very useful if you messup with your xorg file.

      -  Remove existing xorg using the following command:

         sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg

      -  Install xorg using the following command:

         sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg

      -  Reconfigure xorg using the following command

         sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

10.   Adding Launched PPA Repositories

      PPA (Personal Package Archive) repositories. This command is the same as addrepo available on Debian.

      E.g.

      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fcitx-team/stable

11.   gnome-tweak-tool

      sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool

      This tool is for displaying trash can on the Mint13 desktop.

12.   How to resolve the X230 random freeze problem on 12.04.

      Upgrade the kernel from 3.2 to 3.4:

      1) Download the 3 deb packages files.

      linux-image-3.4.0-030400-generic-pae_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_i386.deb
      linux-headers-3.4.0-030400_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_all.deb
      linux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic-pae_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_i386.deb

      2) Go to the download directory and do:

      sudo dkpg -i *.deb

      3) Restart the computer

      sudo init 6

13.   Enabling PAE manually: sudo apt-get install linux-generics-pae linux-headers-generic-pae

      If PAE was successfully enabled you may want to remove the meta-package for the normal kernel. In order to disable unnecessary updates to the non-PAE kernels:

      sudo apt-get remove linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic

      If you want to remove all of the old kernels from your boot menu, it seems like you have to do it all manually:

      sudo apt-get remove linux-image-<version number>-generic linux-headers-<version number>-generic

      If Something went wrong, just remove the PAE kernel packages using either synaptic or apt-get/aptitude.Â If you did not specifically remove the non-PAE kernel 
      packages, they should still be present on the system and automatically selected as the default when the PAE kernel is removed.

      The relevant PAE kernel packages are:

      linux-image-generic-pae  linux-image-<version number>-generic-pae linux-headers-generic-pae linux-headers-<version number>-generic-pae
