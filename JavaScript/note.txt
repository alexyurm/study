Chapter 1 Introduction to JavaScript

-  The traid of technologies that all Web developers must learn:

   -  HTML to specify the content of web pages;
   -  CSS to specify the presentation of web pages;
   -  JavaScript to specify the behavior of web pages.

Chapter 2 Lexical Structure

-  JavaScript programs are wirtten using the Unicode character set. Unicode
   is a superset of ASCII and Latin-1 and supports virtually every written
   language currently used on the planet.

-  JavaScript is case-sensitive language(HTML is not case-sensitive).

Chapter 3 Types, Values and Variables

-  JavaScripts treat all numbers as floating-point values(64-bit IEEE 754 standard).

-  Floating-Point Literals

   [digits][.digits][(E|e)[(+|-)]digits]

   3.14
   .333
   1.42E-32

-  Arithmetic in JavaScript

   Math.row(2, 53)   //2 to power 53
   Math.round(.6)    //1.0: round to the nearest integer
   ...

   Division by zero is not an error in JavaScript: it simply returns infinity or negative infinity. There is one
   exception: zero divided by zero does not have a well defined value, and the result of this operation is the
   special not-a-number value, printed as NaN. NaN also arises if you attempt to divide infinity by infinity or
   take the square root of a negative number or use arithmetic operators with non-numeric operands that cannot
   be converted to numbers.

-  Text

   A string is an immutable ordered sequence of 16-bit values, each of which typically represents a Unicode character.
   JavaScript uses the UTF-16 encoding of the Unicode character set, and JavaScript strings are sequences of unsigned
   16-bit values. The most commonly used Unicode characters (those from the “basic multilingual plane”) have codepoints 
   that fit in 16 bits and can be represented by a single element of a string. Unicode characters whose codepoints do not 
   fit in 16 bits are encoded following the rules of UTF-16 as a sequence (known as a “surrogate pair”) of two 16-bit values. 
   This means that a JavaScript string of length 2 (two 16-bit values) might represent only a single Unicode character:
   
   e.g.

   var p = "π" //π is 1 character with 16-bit codepoint 0x03c0
   var e = 'e' // e is 1 character with 17 bit codepoint 0x1d452
   p.length // -> 1: p consists of 1 16-bit element.
   e.length // -> 2: UTF-16 encoding of e is 2 16-bit values: "\ud835\udc52" (??)

   Note: What is UTF-16?

   UTF-16 is a character encoding for Unicode capable of encoding 1,112,064 numbers (called code points) in the Unicode space from 0
   to 0x10FFFF. The encoding is a variable-length encoding as code points are encoded with one or two 16-bit code units. The Unicode
   code space is divided into seventeen planes of 2^16 (65,536) code points each, through some code points have yet been assigned
   character values, some are reserved for private use, and some are permanently reserved as non-characters. The code points in each
   plane value have the hexadecimal values xx0000 to xxFFFF, where xx is a hex value from 00 to 10, signifying which plane the value
   belong to.

   The first plane (code points U0000 - U+FFFF) contains the most frequently used characters and is called Basic Multilingual Plane(BMP).

   Code points from the other planes (called Supplementary Planes) are encoded in UTF-16 by pairs of 16-bit code units called a surrogate.

-  String

   In client-side JavaScript programming. JavaScript code may contain string of HTML code, and HTML code may contain strings of JavaScript code.
   Thus combining JavaScript and HTML, it is a good idea to use one style of quotes for JavaScripts and the other style for HTML. In the following
   example, the string "Thank You" is single quoted within a JavaScript expression, which is then double-quoted within an HTML event-handeler attribute.

   <button onclick = "alert('Thank you')">Click Me</button>

-  Escape characters

   -  \0        The NUL character(\u0000)
   -  \b        Backspace(\u0008)
   -  \t        Horizontal tab(\u0009)
   -  \n        Newline(\u000A)
   -  \v        Vertical tab(\u0008)
   -  \f        Form feed(\u000C)
   -  \r        Carriage return(\u000D)
   -  \"        Double quote(\u0022)
   -  \'        Single quote(\u0027)
   -  \\        Backslash(\u005c)
   -  \xXX      The Latin-1 character specified by the two hexadecimal digits XX
   -  \xXXXX    The Unicode character specified by the four hexadecimal digits XXXX

-  Pattern Matching(!!)

   JavaScript defines RegExp() constructor for creating objects that represent textual patterns. Text between a pair of slashes constitutes a regular
   expression literal. The second second slash in the pair can also be followed by one or more letters, which modify the meaning of the pattern. For example,
   
   /^HTML/              //Match the letter H T M L at the start of a string
   /[1-9][0-9]*/        //Match a non-zero digit, followed by any # of digits.
   /\bjavascript\b/i    //Match "javascript" as a word, case-insensitive (?? what is "\b" used for here?)

   RegExp objects define a number of useful methods, and strings also have methods that accept RegExp arguments. E.g.

   var text = "testing: 1, 2, 3"; //Sample text
   var pattern = /\d+/g    //Match all instances of one or more digits (??why)
   pattern.text(text)      //-> true: a match exists
   text.search(pattern)    //-> 9: position of first match
   text.match(pattern)     //->["1", "2", "3"]: array of all matches
   text.replace(pattern, "#"); //-> "testing: #, #, #"
   text.split(/\D+/);      //-> ["", "1", "2", "3"]: split on non-digits

-  The Global Object

   The global object is a regular JavaScript object that serves a very important purpose: the properties of the object are the globally defined symbols that are available
   to a JavaScript program. E.g.

   Global properties like: underfined, Infinity, and NaN
   Glogal functions like: isNaN(), parseInt() and eval(
   constructors functions like Date(), RegExp(), String(), Object(), and Array()
   global objects like Math and JSON.

-  Wrapper Objects

   var s = "test", n = 1, b = true;
   var S = new String(s);
   var N = new Number(n);
   var B = new Boolean(b);

   (??What are the Wrapper Objects used for)

-  Immutable Primitive Values and Mutable Object References(!!)

   1) Primitive values are immutable. Such as:

      undefined, null, booleans, numbers and strings 

   2) Objects are different than primitives. First, they are mutable:

   var o = {x:1}; //Start with an object ??what does {x:1} mean here -> It means o.x = 1, x is the variable o's property.
   o.x = 2;
   o.y = 3;

   Also, unlike primitives, objects are not compared by value, they are compared by reference.

   var a = [];
   var b = a;
   b[0] = 1;
   a[0]     // 1: the change is also visible through variable a.
   a === b  // true

-  Type conversions

   10 + " objects"   //-> "10 objects". Number 10 converts to a string.
   "7" * "4"         //-> 28: both strings convert to numbers

   var n = 1- "x";   //-> NaN; string "x" cannot convert to a number. 
   n + " objects"    //-> "NaN objects": NaN converts to string "NaN"

   Note: If JavaScript converts the value to NaN if it cannot perform a meaningful conversion.

   Because JavaScript can convert values flexibility, its == equality operator is also flexible with its notion of equality. All of the following
   comparisions are true, for example, 

   null == underfined //These two values are treated as equal.
   "0" == 0
   0 == false
   "0" == false

   Note: == flexible equality; === strict equality, does not perform conversions when testing for equality.

-  Explicit Conversions

   Although JavaScript performs many type conversions automatically, you may sometimes need to perform an explicit conversion to keep your code clearer(!!I would
   prefer this way).
   
   Number("3")       //->3
   String(false)     //->"false" Or use false.toString()
   Boolean([])       //->true ?? Why
   Object(3)         //-> new Number(3)

   Note: Any value other than null or underfined has a toString() method and the result of this method is usually the same as that returned by the String() function.
   Also, a TypeError is shown if you attempt to convert null or undefined to an object. The object() function does not throw an exception in this case: instead it 
   simply returns a newly created empty object.

   Certain JavaScript operators perform implicit type conversions, and are sometimes used for the purpose of type conversion. E.g. If one operand of the + operator
   is a string, it converts the other one to a string. The unary + operator converts its operand to a number. And the unary ! operator converts its operand to a boolean
   and negates it.

   x + ""   //Same as String()
   +x       //Same as Number(x)
   !!x      //Same as Boolean(x). Note double !

   The toString() method defined by the Number class accepts an optional argument that specifies a radix, or base for the conversion. If you do not specify the argument, 
   the conversion is done in base 10. You can convert numbers in other bases(between 2 and 36). For example,

   var n = 17; //Evaluates to "10001"
   binary_string n.toString(2);  //Evaluates to "021"
   octal_string = "0" + n.toString(8); //Evaluates to "0x11"

Chapter 13 JavaScript in Web Browsers

-  The Window object is the main entry point to all client-side JavaScript features and APIs. It represents a web browser window or frame, and you can refer to it with
   the identifier window. 
   
-  JavaScript is more central to web applications than it is to web documents, of course. JavaScript enhances web documents, but a well-designed document will continue
   to work with JavaScript disabled. Web applications are, by definition, JavaScript programs that use the OS-type service provided by the web browser, and they would
   not be expected to work with JavaScript disabled.

-  Client-side JavaScript code is embedded within HTML document in four ways:

   - Inline, between a pair of <script> and </script> tags;
   - From an external file specified by the src attribute of a <script> tag;
   - In an HTML event handler attribute, such as onclick or onmouseover;
   - In a URL that uses the special javascript: protocol.

-  The <script> tag supports a src attribute that specifies the URL of a file containing JavaScript code:

   <script src="../../scripts/util.js"></script>

   JavaScript file contains pure JavaScript, without <script> tags or any other HTML.
   By convention, files of JavaScript code have names that end with .js.

-  JavaScript code in a script is executed once: when the HTML file that contains it is loaded 
   into the web browser.

   In order to be interactive, a JavaScript program must define event handlers—JavaScript functions that 
   are registered with the web browser and then invoked by the web browser in response to events (such as user input). 
   
   JavaScript code can register an event handler by assigning a function to a property (such as onclick or onmouseover) 
   of an Element object that represents an HTML element in the document.

   Event handler properties like onclick mirror HTML attributes with the same names, and it is possible to define
   event handler that is invoked when the user toggles a checkbox in a form, you can specify the handler code as an
   attribute of the HTML element that defines the checkbox.

   <input type="checkbox name="options" value="giftwrap"
    onchange="order.options.giftwrap=this.checked;">

-  Another way that JavaScript code can be included on the client side is in a URL following the javascript: protocol specifier.
   This special protocol type specifies that the body of the URL is an arbitrary string of JavaScript to run by the JavaScript inter
   preter. It is treated as a single line of code, which means that statements must be seperated by semicolons and that /*  */ comments
   must be used in place by // comments. A JavaScript URL in a hyperlink might look like this:

   <a href="javascript:new Date().toLocalTimeString();">
   Whait is it?
   </a>

   The "resource" identified by a javascript:URL is the return value of the executed code, converted to a string. If the return has an undefined
   return value, the resource has no content. Some browsers such as Firefox uses the returned string as the content of a new document to display.
   Other browsers (such as Chrome and Safari) do not allow URLs like the one above to overwrite the containing document - they just ignore the return
   value of the code. They do, however, still support URLs like this one:

   <a href="javascript:alert(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());">
   Check the time without overwriting the document
   </a>

   Note: The alert() returns underfined. If you want to ensure that a javascript: URL does no overwrite the document, use the void operator to force an
   invocation or assignment expression to be underfined:

   <a href="javascript:void window.open('about:blank');">Open Window</a>

   Without the use of void, the return value of the Window().open() method call would (in some browsers) be converted to a string and displayed, and the
   current document would be overwritten by a document that contains this text:

   [object Window]

   Like HTML event handler, JavaScript URLs are a holdover from the early days of the Web and we should avoid using it. It still does have some useful role
   to play outside of HTML documents. 

   If you need to test a small snippet of JavaScript code, you can type a javascript: URL directly into the location bar of your browser. Another 
   legitimate (and powerful) use of javascript: URLs is in browser bookmarks, as described below.

-  Bookmarklets

   If you bookmark a javascript: URL, you are saving a small script, known as a bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is a mini-program that can be easily 
   launched from the browser’s menus or toolbar.

   As long as a bookmarklet does not return a value, it can operate on whatever document is currently displayed without replacing that document
   with new content.
    
   Consider the following Javascript: URL in <a> tag. Clicking the link opens a simple JavaScript expression evaluator that allows you to 
   evaluate expressions and execute statements in the context of the page:

   <a href='javascript:
       var e = "", r = ""; /* Expression to evaluate the result */
       do {
           /* Display expression and result and ask for a new expression */
           e = prompt("Expression: " + e + "\n" + r + "\n", e);
           try {r = "Result: " + eval(e);} /* Try to evaluate the expression */
           catch(ex) {r = ex;} /* Or remember the error instead */
       } while(e); /* Continue until no expresison entered or Cancel clicked */
       void 0; /* This prevents the current document from being overwritten */
       '>
   JavaScript Evaluator
   </a>

   Note that even though this JavaScript URL is written across multiple lines, the HTML parser treats it as a single line, and 
   single-line // comments will not work in it. Also, remember that the code is all part of a single-quoted HTML attribute, 
   so the code may not contain any single quotes.

-  Execution of JavaScript Programs

   JavaScript program consists of all the JavaScript code in a web page (inline scripts, HTML event handlers, and javascript: URLs) 
   along with external JavaScript code referenced with the src attribute of a <script> tag. All of these separate bits of code
   share a single global Window object. That means that they all see the same Document object, and they share the same set of global 
   functions and variables: if a script defines a new global variable or function, that variable or function will be visible to any Java-
   Script code that runs after the script does.

   The embedded frame(using the <iframe> element), the JavaScript code in the embedded document has a different global object than the code
   in the embedding document, and it can be considered a separate JavaScript program.

   JavaScript program runs in two phases:

   1)

   In the first phase, the document content is loaded and the code from <script> elements (both inline scripts and external 
   scripts) is run. 

   2) 

   Once the document is loaded and all scripts have run, JavaScript execution enters its
   second phase. This phase is asynchronous and event-driven. During this event-driven
   phase, the web browser invokes event handler functions (defined by HTML event han-
   dler attributes, by scripts executed in the first phase, or by previously invoked event
   handlers) in response to events that occur asynchronously. 

   Note: Both core JavaScript and client-side JavaScript have a single-threaded execution model.
   Scripts and event handlers are (or must appear to be) executed one at a time without
   concurrency. This keeps JavaScript programming simple.

-  Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Deferred Scripts.

   The only way that JavaScript code could affect the content of a document was to generate that content
   on the fly while the document was loading. It did this using document.write().

   E.g.

   <h1>Table of Factorials</h1>
   <script>
   function factorial(n) {
      if ( n<=1 ) return n;
   else return n*factorial(n-1);
   }

   document.write("<table>") //Begin a HTML table
   document.write("<tr><th>n</th><th>n!</th></tr>"); //Output table header
   for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {   //Output 10 rows
       document.write("<tr><td>" + i + "</td><td>" + factorial(i) + </td></tr>");
   }
   
   document.write("</table>"); //End of table
   document.write("Generated at " + new Date()); //Output a timestamp
   </script>

   When a script passes text to document.write() , that text is added to the 
   document input stream, and the HTML parser behaves as if the script element 
   had been replaced by that text.
