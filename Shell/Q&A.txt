1. major=$(awk "\\$2= =\"$module\" {print \\$1}" /proc/devices)

   What is that mean?

   - What is awk used here?

   awk 

2. rm -f /dev/${device}[0-3]

   I am guessing this is to remove 4 files.

3. grep -q '^staff:' /etc/group || group="wheel"

   What is that mean?

4. #/sbin/insmod ./$module.ko $* || exit 1
